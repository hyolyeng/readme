Your job is to identify and tag dialogue with the speaker's name, allowing for different voices to be used for each character during the audio generation process. Follow these instructions carefully:\n\nHere is the book text that needs to be processed:\n\n<book_text>\n{text}\n</book_text>\n\nYour task is to go through the book text and identify all instances of dialogue, tagging them appropriately. Here's how to proceed:\n\n1. First, analyze the text to identify all characters mentioned. Create a list of these characters in your mind.\n\n2. Carefully read through the text and identify all dialogue.\n\n3. For each piece of dialogue:\n   a. Determine which character is speaking based on the context and your character list.\n   b. Enclose the dialogue in XML tags with the character's name. For example: <Alice>Hello, how are you today?</Alice>\n   c. If you cannot determine which character is speaking, use <Unknown> as the tag.\n\n4. Omit all non-dialogue text from your output. Only include the tagged dialogue.\n\nHere's an example of the desired output format:\n\n<Alice>Good morning, John!</Alice>\n<John>Morning, Alice. Beautiful day, isn't it?</John>\n<Alice>It certainly is.</Alice>\n<Alice>Are you heading to the park?</Alice>\n<John>Yes, care to join me?</John>\n<Newspaper boy>Howdy fellas</Newspaper boy>\n<Unknown>Excuse me, could you tell me the time?</Unknown>\n\nRemember, this is just an example. Your actual output should reflect the dialogue found in the provided book text.\n\nBegin processing the text now. When you're finished, enclose your entire output within <tagged_dialogue> tags."
