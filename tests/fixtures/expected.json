    "text": "Somewhat surprisingly, Grak was the one who had the most success at actually befriending Esuen. It shouldn't have been surprising, because they had both come from relatively cloistered societies to attend one of the athenaeums and then broken from their home society over irreconcilable differences. Their situations, when I had actually stopped to think about it, were actually pretty similar. Of course, Grak also had some horrible trauma or pain over that falling out which he felt he had to make right, and Esuen was trying to forge a new and different society for her people ... but I guess those differences might have given them something to talk about.\n\nThe Council of Arches was enshrined in the constitution of the Republic of Miunun, a seven-seat \"advisory\" body with broad powers. It was me, Amaryllis, Fenn, Grak, Valencia, and Bethel, with the seventh seat currently unfilled. The position was for life, and none of the seats could be refilled once emptied. It meant that as time went on, the power of the Council would gradually fade, until eventually it was no longer able to make decisions due to not being able to reach a quorum, at which point it would effectively cease to exist for the purposes of governance. The Council of Arches wasn't a dynasty, it was designed to become a vestigial organ.\n\nThe first round of births was going to be in a week's time. Amaryllis had refused to install a touchstone on the Isle of Poran for the time being, citing security concerns, which meant that the only way to get there was to teleport into Ha-lunde and then take a long boat ride over (or pay the exorbitant fees for teleporting direct, without a touchstone). This was beneficial to us in a lot of ways, since it meant people couldn't just stop in whenever they felt like it, but it did produce some constraints on getting in the necessary expertise. We needed professionals to help raise and train up the tuunglings, and had to get everything in place before they were hatched.\n\nIn the meantime, we had business of our own.\n\nI hadn't accrued much power during our few weeks on the Isle of Poran. The two extra points from leveling had gone into MEN, which raised the caps, but most of my skills were above the soft cap of 20, and couldn't be raised higher. I had a few new virtues, from skills that were either slow or impossible to raise in the time chamber, and was working on connection for flower magic with a garden, but that was it. The lowest-hanging fruit still remaining was in unlocking magic, but:\n\n-   We had no idea what Tree Magic, Library Magic, or Spirit actually did, which was part of the logic for why I had included them in the build, but it made unlocking them difficult if not impossible until they presented themselves to us in some way.\n-   To become a velocity mage, you had to move, without magical assistance, faster than the benchmark, and then maintain it for a short period of time. It went up with every velocity mage that was inducted into the ranks. Due to somewhat short-sighted expansion of those ranks during the Second Empire, that meant going more than six hundred miles per hour, and there was presumably some secret to it, because that was really, really fast.\n-   Vibrational Magic was locked to a magic item, which was tightly controlled by the Athenaeum of Sound and Silence, and besides that, rate limited. It was frustrating, because all I needed was a tap on the head, but there was a long line of people waiting in front of me, all of whom had gone through the training necessary to actually utilize the magic.\n-   Revision Magic required being revised backward by a year, which was far more than enough to kill a person, since your body spent that year taking in and expelling matter. The Athenaeum of Claw and Clocks had a collection of entads that would keep you stable, including the Thousand Rings of Stability, but it still meant giving up a year of your life, the so-called \"lost year\" (as memories were lost too), and obviously it took a lot of time and power from an existing revision mage to do the revision.\n-   Still Magic required visiting a temple and meditating there for a week, which wouldn't have been too much of a problem, except that the temple was deep underground, and controlled by the Athenaeum of Sound and Silence.\n-   Water Magic was a bloodline magic, and all I really needed was a teacher, who we'd already contacted and was on her way to come see us. The strict combat utility wasn't all that promising, but the weather control aspects would help a lot on the Isle of Poran.\n-   Fire Magic we could do too, but hadn't. About 1% of the time someone was burned alive, they would awaken horribly scarred but otherwise fine, with the barest powers of a fire magus. If you had sufficient magical healing, you could take someone to the brink and then heal them back as many times as it took for the fire magic to trigger.\n\nWe'd gone over most of this during our week in Barren Jewel, when we'd been shut up in our hotel room waiting out the bout of civil unrest to finish. The big difference now was that we were more or less out of the shadows, and Uniquities was willing to help us with contacts and resources, so long as they could be done via backchannels. We still wanted to keep my abilities secret, at least for the time being, but Amaryllis thought it was likely that I'd be allowed to skip a few of the lines. Once the magics were unlocked, I would race through the required years or decades of training that they each required and become even more of a multimagus ... but we weren't quite at that point yet.\n\nIt was Valencia who had gotten the biggest boosts in the time we'd spent on the Isle of Poran. Part of that was her strength and endurance training, part of it was better skill with her devils and demons, and sure, some of it I guess I would also attribute to Jorge (blegh) working with her, since he had a better knowledge of infernal matters than any of us.\n\nIt wasn't just that though; Bethel had given her some gifts.\n\nThere were a ton of downsides to being non-anima. The general rule was that magic didn't interact with Valencia at all unless it would also interact with (say) a sack of potatoes, which was why we called it the Sack of Potatoes Rule. The soul was, in some sense, the interface that most magic worked on, and without that interface, you were left high and dry. Magical healing was one of the biggest losses, since it simply didn't work on non-anima. Entads were another weak point, since she had no bloodline, couldn't be invested, and they generally didn't respond to her unless they also responded to demons or devils.\n\nThe flip side of this was that Valencia was practically invisible to magic. Wards against blood were, properly speaking, wards against latent, passive, or active blood magic, sometimes with a few stipulations. Valencia's blood had no magic to it at all, and no connection to any soul, which meant that she could slip through all the most common wards without even knowing that they were there. There were very few magics that directly affected the mind, but she was effectively immune to them, about as immune as a sack of potatoes would be. Soul mages were powerless against her, which must have been part of Fallatehr's interest.\n\nWhere Bethel's hobbies and Valencia's abilities intersected, there were cursed magic items.\n\nWay back in the very early versions of D&D, cursed magic items were mostly there to fuck you, because OD&D and AD&D didn't really care whether you lived or died. The whole concept of the roleplaying game hadn't really developed, and characters were just grist to the mill, a loose collection of emergent traits that got stapled onto the much more fully developed mechanics. Magic items in general were a lot more random, and the cursed items even more so. Some of it was funny stuff, like the Ring of Bureaucratic Wizardry, which made you have to fill out forms before you could cast spells, but at the same time, that sort of smacked of \"ha ha, you can't play your character anymore\". Later editions (and other games) either removed the curses, watered them down, or made them big, important things that had actual gravity to them.\n\nAerb did cursed items like I had done cursed items. They weren't 'cursed', exactly, but they had some built-in drawbacks to them that made them dangerous or awkward to use, and there was a good chance that you'd end up hoisted by your own petard. There was a sword that would bleed you for every second you held it in combat, one that you couldn't return to its sheath without having killed something larger than a cat, a spellbook that would drive you mad if you used the same spell twice in a day, all sorts of little catches and hiccups that added in flavor and demanded thought."

When he spoke, it was a stream of Groglir so fast that I had trouble keeping up.\n\nI'd gotten bits and pieces about life in Darili Irid. It was a mile down, but still above the water table thanks to the fact that it was sunk into a mountain at high altitude. It was on the small side, as dwarfholds went, and far away from anything important. The bulk of Darili Irid was in their combination of farming and mining, using the muck that ate stone and produced something blandly edible. It left metals behind, which were gathered up, melted down, and sold via bulk teleportation. It was extremely rare that anyone ever came to Darili Irid, and even more rare that anyone left."
