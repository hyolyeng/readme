I don't want to do that.\" As soon as I said that, a small part of me said, 'actually, I kind of do want to do that'.\n\n\"I'm happy for the lap I'm in,\" said Fenn. She reached down to pet the cat that was curled up on her. \"There's something to be said for laps.\"\n\n\"The Dungeon Master will punish idleness,\" said Grak.\n\n\"I came out of eight months of almost pure idleness entirely unscathed,\" said Amaryllis. She'd returned partial attention to her work. \"I'm starting to trust Juniper's interpretation of the Dungeon Master's views.\"\n\n\"There have got to be limits,\" I said. \"I mean, unless this is going to turn into a totally different game, which I guess is possible, it's really hard to do tabletop games where the game is just managing an estate, or a kingdom, or whatever. The game system isn't set up for massed combat, so all scenarios where there would be massed combat get abstracted out, and the actual play slash narrative is really about this small, plucky band of adventurers doing the things that small bands of people can realistically do.\" I paused. \"That was always how I'd done it anyway.\" The truth was, I was gaining distance from Earth. The memories didn't come as freely as they had back when I'd first arrived on Aerb.\n\nIt was hard to reconcile Uther and Arthur, but when I tried, that was always what I came back to. A teenager from Earth, immersed in this other world, with no one and nothing from home but the things he could bring forward from his memories. He spent his entire adult life on Aerb. My working theory was that he wasn't obsessed with Tiff, making drawings of her because of a long-ago love that had never faded. Instead, she was nostalgia incarnate, a memory so old that it might have been a dream. He'd drawn her to say to himself that yes, there really had been such a place as Earth, it hadn't all been a vivid dream. But Uther had lived his life at full tilt, always one adventure after another, even during the time he was founding his empire, so the years wouldn't have felt like years, they'd have felt like decades, more distance ... and he'd have felt a keening for his childhood, which happened in that faraway, ephemeral place called Earth. That was also my working theory for what Uther was looking for down the Boundless Pit: home.\n\nNone of that excused what he'd done with Bethel. Maybe none of that was even true. It made me sick to think about, and sympathetic toward Arthur and the pain he'd felt, and frustrated with the lack of answers about what had happened to him. I didn't really know who he had been.\n\n\"Well I'd rather not have an adventure just for the sake of it,\" said Fenn. \"But speaking of adventures for the sake of it, can we finally play Arches? We're all here, we've got nothing better to do, I've had my campaign ready for ages, and I know that Juniper's got stuff ready if we want to play his. Mary?\"\n\n\"I ... yes,\" said Amaryllis. She began sorting some papers. \"Give me a minute to file things away, I can spare two or three hours.\"\n\n\"Well, that's the hard one,\" said Fenn. \"Grak?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"Juniper's? Or yours?\"\n\n\"Actually,\" I said. \"Bethel and Val have never played a roleplaying game before, so I was thinking that maybe we would start with something fast and easy that we can get through quickly?\" I bent down and gave Fenn a kiss. \"Come on, up.\"\n\nShe mumbled something about 'cozy', despite being the one that wanted to get a game going, and eventually got up so we could get to the big table, where we ate most of our meals. With Bethel in full control of the backpack's powers, hot food appeared on plates right in front of us, exactly to order. Valencia, as had become typical, said that this was exactly like the Great Hall at Hogwarts. For our impromptu game night, there were cans of pop and bags of chips.\n\n\"A new game?\" asked Solace as she sat down at the table. She had a booster on her chair, so she could rest her arms on the table. \"I rather liked Arches.\"\n\n\"Arches is rules-light, but it's not that rules-light,\" I said, as I watched everyone gather. \"Bethel?\" I asked the room.\n\nShe appeared in her customary seat at the table, which was as illusory as her physical form. \"I'm listening,\" she said.\n\n\"Always listening,\" muttered Fenn.\n\n\"I don't particularly care if you have sex,\" said Bethel. \"Hundreds of people have had sex in my rooms.\"\n\n\"Well, I care,\" said Fenn.\n\n\"Do you?\" asked Solace. \"I seem to recall you being quite free with your love.\"\n\n\"They were,\" said Amaryllis. She took her seat next to Solace.\n\n\"If people know, it's -- whatever,\" said Fenn. \"I'm not going to feel ashamed about that. But someone actively watching feels too much like a third person in there with us. I'm not into it.\" She looked at me.\n\n\"I understand,\" I said. I didn't agree, but I did understand. The locus could (probably) see everything in its domain, but apparently that didn't trip the same internal reaction in Fenn. I thought it was probably just the fact that it was Bethel that got to Fenn. Our newly-acquired house was perfect, imperious, and powerful, much like the elves that had judged her unworthy when she was growing up.\n\n\"You were saying about a different game?\" asked Valencia.\n\n\"Yeah,\" I said. \"Arches is light on rules, but it's on the heavy end of light, if that makes sense. I was thinking that we could warm up with something that's single stat, single die, what they used to call a one-page game. There are a couple to choose from, ones I know well enough that I shouldn't need a refresher, and Bethel should be able to snag the rules. In Honey Heist you're all different bears and you've got two stats, Bear and Criminal that you use for everything, um, Lasers and Feelings probably doesn't translate, since it's a Star Trek pastiche, and the same probably goes for Actual Cannibal Shia LaBeouf, which --\"\n\n\"Stop,\" said Amaryllis.
