Essentially, if you have a body of work built up, that engenders expectations, and in the context of an audience's reaction to narrative --\"\n\n\"Snooze, pass, I'm done with it,\" said Fenn. She rolled her eyes at Amaryllis' faint frown. \"Look, I'm sorry if you find it interesting or worth spending time on, but unless it's actually going to help us in some way, I don't give a crap, and I don't think anyone else should either.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" said Amaryllis with a shrug. \"But you should know that it was a really interesting point.\"\n\n\"I'll put it on my internal scoreboard,\" said Fenn with a smile.\n\n\"Is this how you two are when you're alone together?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, exactly like that,\" said Fenn. \"But usually we're naked and having a pillow fight while we talk.\"\n\n\"She does that with you too?\" asked Valencia.\n\nFenn stopped and looked at Valencia, who was doing an absolute pitch-perfect job of showing confused innocence. I couldn't stop myself from laughing.\n\n\"Are you using a devil to sell the joke?\" asked Amaryllis with a frown.\n\nValencia held up her thumb and forefinger, half an inch apart from each other.\n\n\"Well, it was funny, I'll give you that,\" said Fenn.\n\n\"You really need to stop doing that,\" said Amaryllis. \"If they find out what's happening, and trace it back to you, they have methods of influencing Aerb. The hells haven't been united since the time of the Apocalypse Demon, and the dent Uther put in our cosmology has helped ensure only the weak can make it up, but trillions of infernals unified again isn't really something that we should risk for a joke.\"\n\n\"I'll just kill them all,\" said Valencia. \"Jorge thinks that I should anyway.\"\n\n\"That sounds like exactly the sort of thing we should have a long talk about in the Council of Arches first,\" said Fenn. \"I don't think we included a clause about genocide in the charter, but maybe we should have.\"\n\n\"If we're going to do it, better we do it as quickly as possible,\" I said. Amaryllis glared at me. \"I'm just saying, if there are a trillion people in the hells, which there might be, and they're being ... I don't know, physically and psychologically tortured, then murdering all the devils and demons is probably the most possible good we can do, right?\"\n\n\"That's what Jorge said,\" replied Valencia.\n\n\"How many tendrils do you have?\" asked Amaryllis. \"Last I checked, it was seventeen, and it took you some time to move them around.\"\n\n\"I have more than ten thousand,\" said Valencia. \"But I'm close to my limit, for now, because there's starting to be a little strain. I was able to add more after Juniper leveled up.\"\n\nI hadn't really been keeping abreast of the research into Val's powers, on the thinking that Amaryllis wasn't likely to miss anything that I would catch. My attempts at putting some distance between Valencia and myself seemed to be working, at least as far as her attachment to me went. I knew that her sight into the hells was a bit limited, not enough for surveillance, though we had infernoscopes for that if we really needed, and if we didn't want to look at anything too far down. I also knew that the tendrils couldn't be used on people in hell, which had been one of my first questions; that, at least, would have been a no-brainer, whatever you thought about the wisdom of antagonizing the infernals.\n\nWe moved on to other topics, and went through a few cycles of testing weapons and armor for Valencia. The game had termed her Valencia the Red, and as it turned out, the Red Armor of Arramor worked perfectly on her, which was a little bit on the nose. There were different methods that armor used to shape itself to a person, and the Red Armor of Arramor used the method that would have worked on a sack of potatoes; conforming to whatever was placed inside it and hoping that the joints would work out on their own. There were different methods of reducing damage, or even knowing what damage was, and the Red Armor of Arramor used the method that would have worked on a sack of potatoes, stopping 'incoming' kinetic energy with respect to itself if preset thresholds were exceeded. And finally, there were different methods it might have used to dish the pain back out at the top of the hour, but apparently, it interfaced with the soul's conception of the body in order to determine what damage would have been done before directly applying it.\n\nI was envious of the armor, naturally. I had given up my sword to Bethel, and didn't have a replacement yet. The armor I traditionally wore was fine, but it was a little bit lackluster. Valencia took the Memory Blade too, though we didn't really have a good way of testing it, not given that we wanted to keep all our memories.\n\nBeyond the armor and the blades, Valencia also wore the crown, which was made of thorns in what was painfully obvious as a reference to Jesus. Given the thorns, I was thinking it would be some sort of damage reflection, but no, it soaked up poisons and toxins (from a preset list without need for bodily reference) and transformed them into mental afflictions.\n\n\"I'll get some guns for you too,\" said Amaryllis. \"There's absolutely no reason that we should waste your perfect aim by handing you a sword. We're at least six months out from our machine shops being up and running, let alone able to produce the knock-off P90s I want, but I have a shipment of pistols and rifles coming in.\"\n\n\"You do?\" I asked."}, {"speaker": "Amaryllis", "text": "Thrones?"}, {"speaker": "NARRATOR", "text": "ing horrible,\" I said, staying in Groglir. \"An invasion?

He wasn't telling me so I could diagnose the problem, or propose a solution. \"Can I -- how many?\".\n\n\"Two thousand, three hundred, forty-six,\" said Grak. \"Everyone.\".\n\nI tried to grapple with that number. It seemed too big. It seemed like the kind of thing that would have made national headlines, something that couldn't possibly have escaped my notice ... but I hadn't been searching for answers, and Darili Irid was, by Grak's account, a small hole in the ground whose primary interaction with imperial affairs was paying a pittance in taxes.

We'll help you get your gold, ideally before the two years are up, and then I'll come with you to Darili Irid.\" I'd been trying to think of the lines that I might use to convince him to stay with us, but nothing I thought of sounded convincing, and I was pretty sure that in his position, I wouldn't have listened.\n\nLoyalty Increased: Grak lvl 13!.\n\nI didn't feel good about that. Grak was his own person, he wanted to be his own person, finding us and becoming a part of the Council of Arches, heart and soul, was, in his eyes, sort of a betrayal of the person he thought of himself as being. All I was really doing was increasing that tension, without actually helping to ease or resolve it. I didn't know whether loyalty actually did anything, aside from the bonuses it granted, but I hadn't seen it go down yet, and if it was magically modifying their minds instead of just acting as a gauge of what they thought about me ... well, that wouldn't feel good either.\n\nFenn looked out over the haul from the cavern, which we'd dumped out of the glove. Grak had gone to be on his own, which I could understand. That left me, Fenn, Bethel, Amaryllis, and, of course, Valencia.\n\n\"I don't understand why someone would use some of this stuff,\" said Fenn.\n\n\"Mortals are attracted to power,\" said Bethel. \"The ones who tried to raid me were more attracted than most. Some of them were desperate, and many of these tools are the tools of desperation.\".\n\nMy eyes landed on the Memory Blade, which I thought was a good contender for Valencia's primary weapon. It became sharper the more memories it ate, and according to Bethel, at its height it was capable of cutting through stone like it was soft butter. It fed from both the person who wielded it and whoever it hit, heedless of the damage it was causing. Valencia didn't have memories, or at least, not memories stored in her soul, which meant that in theory, she could use the blade with only the upside. It was dull now, since it had been a century since it was used, but it could build up again with time.\n\n\"Armor is going to be a problem,\" said Amaryllis. \"Most of it will change shape to fit whoever wears it, at least to some extent, but I'm not sure that will work for Valencia.\".\n\n\"It wouldn't be too hard to get a body double, right?\" I asked.\n\n\"We're talking about cursed armor here,\" said Fenn. \"Maybe let's not put random strangers into it?\".\n\nValencia was staring at a suit of red armor covered with tiny, curved thorns. Bethel had termed it the Red Armor of Arramor, which was one I'd come up with for our Long Stairs campaign. If you were wearing it, you wouldn't take any damage until the top of the hour, at which point that damage would be dealt to both the wearer and whoever had done the damage. There were a bunch of ways to bypass it, but it was total protection against a whole lot of damage. In our games, the biggest catch to it had been that healing didn't actually work until after you'd taken the damage ... which came all at once, triggering massive damage rules and/or pushing people below the maximum amount of negative damage. You also couldn't take it off if you had damage pending, which Reimer learned to his intense displeasure; he wasn't terribly good at roleplaying a guy who knew he only had fifteen minutes to live.\n\n\"We'll need to test some of this stuff,\" I said. \"Test whether the armor will conform to Valencia, test which parts of which abilities work, et cetera. Shouldn't take us more than a day, I don't think.\".\n\n\"Was any of this meant for me?\" asked Valencia. She was staring at the armor as she spoke it.\n\n\"Meant for you?\" asked Bethel.\n\n\"The Dungeon Master nudges things sometimes,\" I said. \"He, uh, sets things up. Let's say there are a billion entads, most of them not great, right? Well, we've come across what, maybe two dozen so far? Much more, if you include all the ones that nominally belong to Amaryllis, or the ones that I've heard about in passing, and definitely if you include Uther's stuff. But of the ones that we actually have, or have interacted with, a hugely disproportionate number have been ones that I personally created, or which were used in the games that I played. It's proof of the Dungeon Master's thumb on the scale somewhere in the process.\".\n\n\"Ah,\" said Bethel. She frowned at all the entads she'd chosen not to take in. \"So the thought is that this powerful entity sent people to their deaths inside of me because he foresaw that I would elect not to take them, that you would come to me, that I would choose not to kill you, and that Valencia would both be present in this party and live through her altercation at Headwater.\".\n\n\"Valencia is invincible,\" said Fenn.\n\n\"Am not,\" said Valencia.\n\n\"Are too,\" said Fenn. She had some experience; they'd been training together in the gym, and despite Fenn's avowed laziness, she had been spending a fair amount of time there. \"I've never seen you take a hit. 'If you prick her, does she not bleed?' Well, no, because you're not going to be able to prick her, she'll dodge out of the way of the needle and then break your arm in two places.\".\n\n\"I said I was sorry,\" said Valencia.\n\n\"Never said I was upset,\" said Fenn.\n\n\"You swore a lot,\" said Amaryllis. \"And then said that you were going to break her arm in her sleep.\".\n\n\"I say a lot of things,\" said Fenn.\n\n\"Back to the matter at hand,\" I said. \"Yes, it's very possible that the Dungeon Master either foresaw everything and nudged it into the right configuration, or foresaw bits and pieces of things and set up a bunch of possibilities. Maybe ... I mean, it's possible that each of these was intended for a different possible future, and the ones that seem obviously meant for Valencia are just because that's the timeline we ended up in, right?\".\n\n\"I'm kind of over the existential stuff,\" said Fenn. \"Bible study helped a lot with that.\".\n\n\"It's also possible that the Dungeon Master cheats more than he lets on,\" said Amaryllis. \"He simply placed that armor there for Valencia a few days ago and retroactively altered all memories and evidence to fit a world where it had always been there.\".\n\n\"Sure,\" I said. \"If we're talking about random bullshit powers, yes, that's entirely possible.\".\n\n\"But it's to our benefit,\" said Bethel.\n\n\"I'm going to try the armor on,\" said Valencia.\n\n\"Sure,\" I said. \"We'll test it in the least harmful way possible.\".\n\n\"It's to our benefit now,\" said Amaryllis. \"In the future? Maybe not so much. Also in the past, though it's hard to say.\".\n\n\"She's still salty about the password-protected tattoo variant,\" said Fenn with a laugh.\n\n\"Because it was bullshit,\" said Amaryllis. \"The whole fucking thing, and yes, I'm still quote salty unquote about it. We were specifically fucked by a black swan.\".\n\n\"Like Leda,\" said Fenn.\n\n\"Sometimes there are black swans,\" I said, ignoring whatever nonsense Fenn was talking about. \"I mean, you don't include them in narratives without some foreshadowing or multiple viewpoints, which basically means that you don't do them in tabletop games, but ... I thought maybe that was the point?\".\n\n\"The fuck kind of point is that?\" asked Fenn.\n\n\"I'm inclined to agree with the spirit of that question,\" said Bethel.\n\n\"No, I understand it,\" said Amaryllis. \"Fenn, did you ever get around to reading A Game of Thrones ?\""}, {"speaker": "Fenn", "text": "Nope,"}, {"speaker": "NARRATOR", "text": "said Fenn."}, {"speaker": "Fenn", "text": "If you wanted me to read books, you shouldn't have invented television."}, {"speaker": "Amaryllis", "text": "It's fine,"}, {"speaker": "NARRATOR", "text": "said Amaryllis."}, {"speaker": "Amaryllis", "text": "It was just a good example.

My attempts at putting some distance between Valencia and myself seemed to be working, at least as far as her attachment to me went. I knew that her sight into the hells was a bit limited, not enough for surveillance, though we had infernoscopes for that if we really needed, and if we didn't want to look at anything too far down. I also knew that the tendrils couldn't be used on people in hell, which had been one of my first questions; that, at least, would have been a no-brainer, whatever you thought about the wisdom of antagonizing the infernals.\n\nWe moved on to other topics, and went through a few cycles of testing weapons and armor for Valencia. The game had termed her Valencia the Red, and as it turned out, the Red Armor of Arramor worked perfectly on her, which was a little bit on the nose. There were different methods that armor used to shape itself to a person, and the Red Armor of Arramor used the method that would have worked on a sack of potatoes; conforming to whatever was placed inside it and hoping that the joints would work out on their own. There were different methods of reducing damage, or even knowing what damage was, and the Red Armor of Arramor used the method that would have worked on a sack of potatoes, stopping 'incoming' kinetic energy with respect to itself if preset thresholds were exceeded. And finally, there were different methods it might have used to dish the pain back out at the top of the hour, but apparently, it interfaced with the soul's conception of the body in order to determine what damage would have been done before directly applying it.\n\nI was envious of the armor, naturally. I had given up my sword to Bethel, and didn't have a replacement yet. The armor I traditionally wore was fine, but it was a little bit lackluster. Valencia took the Memory Blade too, though we didn't really have a good way of testing it, not given that we wanted to keep all our memories.\n\nBeyond the armor and the blades, Valencia also wore the crown, which was made of thorns in what was painfully obvious as a reference to Jesus. Given the thorns, I was thinking it would be some sort of damage reflection, but no, it soaked up poisons and toxins (from a preset list without need for bodily reference) and transformed them into mental afflictions.\n\n\"I'll get some guns for you too,\" said Amaryllis. \"There's absolutely no reason that we should waste your perfect aim by handing you a sword. We're at least six months out from our machine shops being up and running, let alone able to produce the knock-off P90s I want, but I have a shipment of pistols and rifles coming in.\""}, {"speaker": "Amaryllis", "text": "You do?"}, {"speaker": "NARRATOR", "text": "I asked."}], "voices": {"NARRATOR": {"voice_id": "CwhRBWXzGAHq8TQ4Fs17", "description": null, "labels": {"accent": "American", "description": "confident", "age": "middle-aged", "gender": "male", "use_case": "social media"}, "name": "Roger"}, "Grak": {"voice_id": "JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb", "description": null, "labels": {"accent": "British", "description": "warm", "age": "middle aged", "gender": "male", "use_case": "narration"}, "name": "George"}, "Bethel": {"voice_id": "FGY2WhTYpPnrIDTdsKH5", "description": null, "labels": {"accent": "American", "description": "upbeat", "age": "young", "gender": "female", "use_case": "social media"}, "name": "Laura"}, "Fenn": {"voice_id": "cgSgspJ2msm6clMCkdW9", "description": null, "labels": {"accent": "American", "description": "expressive", "age": "young", "gender": "female", "use_case": "conversational"}, "name": "Jessica"}, "Amaryllis": {"voice_id": "EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL", "description": null, "labels": {"accent": "american", "description": "soft", "age": "young", "gender": "female", "use_case": "news"}, "name": "Sarah"}, "Valencia": {"voice_id": "pFZP5JQG7iQjIQuC4Bku", "description": null, "labels": {"accent": "British", "description": "warm", "age": "middle-aged", "gender": "female", "use_case": "narration"}, "name": "Lily"}, "I": {"voice_id": "onwK4e9ZLuTAKqWW03F9", "description": null, "labels": {"accent": "British", "description": "authoritative", "age": "middle-aged", "gender": "male", "use_case": "news"}, "name": "Daniel"}}}
