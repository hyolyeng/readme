<Juniper>"And there's a screening protocol for that?"</Juniper> I asked.

<Masters>"There are certain things that I would not say to a dream-skewered, for reasons of their health and safety."</Masters>

<Juniper>"Valencia?"</Juniper> I asked, turning to her. She was sitting just to my left, with her fingers resting on my thigh, where she could tap in code to tell me what she was picking up without Masters being able to see. So far, nothing.

<Valencia>"What's your species?"</Valencia>

<Masters>"Ell,"</Masters> replied Masters, looking at Valencia more closely. She had used a voice of command and authority, but it was still a girl's voice.

<Valencia>"You trained with the Elon Gar,"</Valencia> said Valencia.

Masters nodded once, cautiously. <Masters>"It's not uncommon for my people,"</Masters> he said. <Masters>"Sleep is more of a thief to us than almost any of the other mortal species."</Masters>

<Masters>"You were trained inexpertly,"</Masters> said Valencia with some satisfaction. She turned to look at me through the eye slits of the armor. The decorative thorns around them looked a bit like flames. <Valencia>"He's lying."</Valencia>

<Masters>"I'm not lying,"</Masters> said Masters. <Masters>"I do need to perform a screening. There's more to the dream-skewered than you know."</Masters> I felt my heart start beating a little faster at that. Did he know about the Cannibal? Or was this about something else?

<Juniper>"But it's not for health and safety?"</Juniper> I asked.

Masters paused. <Masters>"No,"</Masters> he said.

<Valencia>"He's following deeper directives,"</Valencia> Valencia supplied.

<Juniper>"Then we both have information the other wants,"</Juniper> I said. I hesitated for just a tick. There was no way that they were going to involuntarily commit me, not when we had this much firepower on our side. <Juniper>"I'm dream-skewered."</Juniper>

Masters sucked in a breath, which he let out slowly. <Masters>"Then it's all the more important that I screen you."</Masters>

<Juniper>"Looking for what?"</Juniper> I asked.

<Masters>"There are different presentations of the phenomenon,"</Masters> said Masters.

<Amaryllis>"What form does this screening take?"</Amaryllis> asked Amaryllis.

<Masters>"You'll hold an entad in your hand while I say a series of words,"</Masters> said Masters. <Masters>"The entad will change colors, giving a reading of your surface level recognition."</Masters>

<Juniper>"I consent,"</Juniper> I replied.

Masters nodded briefly, then excused himself so he could retrieve the entad he would need.

<Amaryllis>"Grak, are we good to talk?"</Amaryllis> asked Amaryllis, as soon as Masters was gone.

<Grak>"Likely,"</Grak> said Grak.

<Fenn>"Luck sense isn't getting pinged yet,"</Fenn> said Fenn. <Fenn>"Common sense is screaming at me to get out of here though."</Fenn>

<Amaryllis>"I'm worried about black swans,"</Amaryllis> said Amaryllis. <Amaryllis>"Really worried. There's too much power concentrated here. Something isn't right."</Amaryllis>

<Fenn>"If he were coming back to kill us, I'm pretty sure I would feel it,"</Fenn> said Fenn.

<Juniper>"He might just be trying to contain the infohazard we're here to warn him about,"</Juniper> I said. <Juniper>"That would be consistent with his level of caution."</Juniper> I hesitated. <Juniper>"Val, you said that he was lying about it being for my health and safety?"</Juniper>

<Valencia>"I was bluffing,"</Valencia> she said. <Valencia>"It seemed like a good idea at the time. He is out of practice, or wasn't trained well, but he's still very hard to read, and he's trying very hard to keep it that way."</Valencia>

<Amaryllis>"Well, --"</Amaryllis> began Amaryllis.

The door opened back up, and Masters slipped back inside. He was holding a small gray ball in his hand. It was slightly reflective, with striations on the surface that reminded me of marble. In his other hand, he held a sheet of papers.

<Masters>"You can have your warder inspect the entad, if you would like,"</Masters> said Masters. He took his seat once more, placed the papers on the table, then rolled the ball from one hand to the other. <Masters>"I'll demonstrate its use. Say a noun or noun phrase, one that you would expect me to know, then one that you wouldn't expect me to know."</Masters> He picked the ball up, holding it in his hand.

<Juniper>"Anglecynn,"</Juniper> I said. The ball in his hand lit up a bright green. I paused, trying to think carefully about a noun that he wouldn't know. <Juniper>"Fenn Greenglass."</Juniper> The ball lit up again, this time emitting a gray light before fading back to its base, unlit state. It was on our intake form, but he hadn't read that, and we'd made no formal introductions. He set it down on the table again. <Juniper>"How many colors?"</Juniper> I asked.

<Masters>"Four,"</Masters> said Masters. <Masters>"Green is known to you personally, blue is known to you from some outside source, grey is unknown, and yellow is known and then later forgotten. Intensity of light matches intensity of knowledge."</Masters> He rolled the ball across the table to me. I glanced at Grak, who gave me a nod, then picked it up, feeling its weight. <Masters>"It's harmless, save for the information it allows me to obtain."</Masters> The ball pulsed green as he spoke, once each for 'it', 'information', 'it' and 'me'.

<Juniper>"Okay,"</Juniper> I said. <Juniper>"I'm ready."</Juniper>

<Masters>"We'll start slowly,"</Masters> said Masters. He paused. <Masters>"Really, I should have the rest of you leave the room, so as not to influence future screenings. It's not normally a concern, but --"</Masters>

<Juniper>"No,"</Juniper> I said. <Juniper>"I'm freely admitting to being dream-skewered. If the others were, they would say so as well."</Juniper>

Masters nodded. <Masters>"Very well."</Masters> He looked down at his papers. <Masters>"We'll start slow. Before we begin, can you give me a rough estimate of how long it's been since you were transferred to Aerb?"</Masters>

I frowned as I tried to think about that. From whose reference frame? <Juniper>"Four months,"</Juniper> I said.

Masters gave me a quizzical look. I was fairly sure that was longer than the average. <Masters>"Many features of Aerb will be familiar to you then."</Masters>

<Juniper>"Yes,"</Juniper> I replied. Much more than you know. I was a tiny bit worried about that.

Masters cleared his throat. <Masters>"Let's begin then. The Empire of Common Cause."</Masters> The ball turned green in my hand. <Masters>"Aerb."</Masters> Once again the ball turned green. <Masters>"Invreizen."</Masters> Blue.

This continued on for longer than it seemed like it should have. I understood that it was probably calibration, but I didn't really need thirty names and places from Aerb in a row. At first they were blue or green across the board, but the last ten had a few yellow and gray, presumably because they were more obscure. Whatever Mome Rath was, I had apparently forgotten it.

And then, without seeming to switch gears at all, Masters said <Masters>"Earth"</Masters>, which came up green.

<Masters>"England,"</Masters> said Masters. Blue.

<Masters>"The United States of America,"</Masters> said Masters. Green.

He was holding his paper up slightly, so I couldn't read what was on it from where I was sitting. I was suddenly curious whether this was a list or a flowchart. If dream-skewered came from England, you'd need a different chart for them, wouldn't you? He continued with places for a bit.

<Masters>"Adolf Hitler,"</Masters> said Masters. Blue. <Masters>"John Fitzgerald Kennedy."</Masters> Blue. <Masters>"Richard Nixon."</Masters> Blue. <Masters>"Bill Gates."</Masters> Blue. <Masters>"Silicon Valley."</Masters> Blue.

We were moving forward in time, that much was clear. Was the purpose of the screening to figure out what time the dream-skewered were from? But that didn't make sense, since there didn't seem to be any reason you couldn't just ask, aside from maybe the mind-fuck of someone asking what year you thought it was.

<Masters>"Elon Musk."</Masters> Blue. <Masters>"Justin Bieber."</Masters> Blue. <Masters>"Miley Cyrus."</Masters> Blue. Even after all that I'd spent two months in the chamber steeped back into Earth culture, it was utterly bizarre to hear these names coming from the mouth of an armored man while sitting at a conference table. <Masters>"Henry Swift."</Masters> Gray. <Masters>"Abigail March."</Masters> Gray. I frowned at that. Testing for false positives? Or something else? <Masters>"Abigail Breslin."</Masters> Blue. <Masters>"Adam Driver."</Masters> Blue. <Masters>"Zootopia."</Masters> Green. <Masters>"Finding Dory."</Masters> Green. We continued on with movies for a while, all of them somewhat recent. I'd heard of all of them; the ones I'd seen showed up green, while the ones I hadn't showed blue. The movies were a surprise, but it was expected that someone who ran a dorm filled with dream-skewered would have in-depth knowledge of Earth. So close to the time I left though â€¦ that was curious.

I kept waiting for the moment he would mention a movie in the Cannibal's filmography. Was this an infohazard they had already contained? Was that the purpose of this?

<Masters>"Arthur Blum,"</Masters> said Masters. The ball lit up a bright green.

He said the name like it was any other thing on that list. I wanted to stop him, but I was too shocked to say anything.

<Masters>"Tiffany Archer,"</Masters> said Masters. Green. <Masters>"Arthur Reimer."</Masters> Green again. <Masters>"Thomas Clint."</Masters> Green.

I sat there as he listed off a dozen names. The ones that weren't members of our gaming group were people we'd gone to high school with. I just sat there in stunned silence, watching the ball turn green again and again.

<Masters>"We're done,"</Masters> said Masters. He was looking at me calmly, as though nothing was strange about any of this. <Masters>"You said that your own name was Juniper Smith."</Masters> The ball flashed green for a final time, and I gently set it down on the table.

We sat in silence for a bit. Maybe Masters was waiting for me to speak, but I had nothing to say.

<Juniper>"So,"</Juniper> I said slowly. <Juniper>"Where does that list come from?"</Juniper>

<Masters>"Uther Penndraig, the Lost King,"</Masters> said Masters.

I stayed silent for a moment, looking at the wall to the left of Masters' head. <Juniper>"And â€¦ how many does the average dream-skewered get from that list?"</Juniper>

<Masters>"How many would you guess?"</Masters> asked Masters. His voice was flat, emotionless.

<Juniper>"I don't know,"</Juniper> I said. <Juniper>"Mome Rath was the last of the Aerbian ones?"</Juniper>

Masters nodded.

<Juniper>"Then â€¦ I would guess that they stop somewhere around Adolf Hitler."</Juniper> I wasn't sure about that. I had wondered why, if there were a thousand dream-skewered, none of them had done something like what Arthur had done. Surely with a thousand of them over the course of the last five hundred years, one would have been an engineer capable of making the advances that Amaryllis was planning. My current working theory was that most of the dream-skewered came from earlier in Earth's history, maybe centered around a bell curve, with Arthur at the very far end, which would solve a lot of the problems inherent in the worldbuilding aspects, but --

<Valencia>"There are no dream-skewered,"</Valencia> said Valencia.

Masters hesitated, then nodded.

Quest Completed: The Name of the Beast - I guess some problems just solve themselves.

The Veil of the World

<Amaryllis>"They're a recognized phenomenon,"</Amaryllis> said Amaryllis. <Amaryllis>"To maintain the deception for so long, under so much scrutiny, you'd need --"</Amaryllis>

<Masters>"Powerful magic,"</Masters> replied Masters.

<Amaryllis>"I was going to say that you'd need the complicity of far too many people,"</Amaryllis> replied Amaryllis. <Amaryllis>"People -- scholars -- would come to this place and they'd want to speak with the dream-skewered, they'd want to take notes, they'd want to know things about Earth. You can't possibly have -- how could you possibly have kept up the pretense for five hundred years?"</Amaryllis>

<Masters>"It's not important,"</Masters> said Masters. He was still looking at me.

<Juniper>"What's important is what happens now,"</Juniper> I said. I was watching Masters. If there were no dream-skewered, that meant that someone had created the myth, and done it with purpose. I thought it was probably easier than Amaryllis was making it out to be; the dream-skewered were a curiosity, nothing more, a footnote rather than one of the greater mysteries of the universe. <Juniper>"Uther Penndraig gave you those names. Why?"</Juniper>

<Masters>"Together, we might find the truth,"</Masters> said Masters. He stood up from his chair. <Masters>"Come with me."</Masters>

I stayed where I was and looked to Valencia.

<Valencia>"I â€¦ I don't know,"</Valencia> she said. <Valencia>"He's soaked in weariness. Maybe intentionally. It might be masking something else."</Valencia>

<Masters>"These are your knights?"</Masters> asked Masters.

<Juniper>"Knights?"</Juniper> I asked.

<Masters>"As Uther had,"</Masters> replied Masters.

<Juniper>"No, not really,"</Juniper> which was a bald-faced lie. I turned to Fenn. <Juniper>"Verdict?"</Juniper>

<Fenn>"Nothing is twigging,"</Fenn> she said with a shrug. <Fenn>"That doesn't mean that it's safe."</Fenn>

I stood from my seat. <Juniper>"Okay then. Uther â€¦ what, he left me something?"</Juniper>

Masters nodded once. <Masters>"I haven't seen it myself."</Masters> He stepped away from the table, leaving his papers and his entad behind, and went to the conference room's door without another word. He moved like he wasn't sure of himself. Five hundred years of perpetuating this deception? All, presumably, for this?

We walked down the hall. I followed close behind him, with Valencia and Grak flanking me as best they could. Masters seemed like he was in a daze, and I felt like I was in a daze too. When Amaryllis had told me that there was a condition that caused people to believe they were from Earth, I had thought that it was just something to explain away the fact that I was on Aerb. Later on â€¦ well, I'd taken a tiny bit of comfort in the fact that there were other people who remembered Earth on Aerb. To find out that they were all just figments was, strangely, a bit crushing. I hadn't been sure what I was going to do with the other dream-skewered, but now all those possibilities had been washed away.

We went up to the fourth floor, the place with heavy wards. Valencia was watching Masters carefully, while Grak watched for unknown magic. I wasn't sure what trick he had up his sleeve, if any, but we were going to be as prepared as we could possibly be for it. I didn't like this new development.

We came to a large, circular room with a mirror standing in the center of it. The mirror was ornate, gilded around the outside edge, with swoops and swirls that suggested something floral.

<Grak>"Entad,"</Grak> said Grak. <Grak>"It has marks of display and illusion."</Grak>

<Masters>"Uther spoke into it,"</Masters> said Masters as he stared into the mirror. <Masters>"Only the intended recipient can hear what he had to say."</Masters>

<Juniper>"Tell me more,"</Juniper> I said, not moving toward the mirror. <Juniper>"Tell me â€¦ tell me why you would devote your life to this."</Juniper>

<Masters>"I hadn't intended to,"</Masters> said Masters. <Masters>"There were dream-skewered, once upon a time. Five of them, all presenting within a handful of years, all collected together in a madhouse, in the city that would later become Boastre Vino. Uther took an interest. He was, in that time, a man known for doing impossible things, for solving unsolvable problems, erudite beyond anyone of that period, wise far beyond his years."</Masters> He was staring at the mirror as he spoke. <Masters>"Uther tasked me with watching for more of the dream-skewered. He created a generous endowment for their care. I was to conduct interviews with them, find what they knew, compile a book or two. He wanted me to cast a wide net, and I did."</Masters> Masters sighed, still staring at the mirror. <Masters>"Five unremarkable people, that was all we ever had. Of course, once the stories of the dream-skewered began to spread, there were others who came to see me and my small staff. We became something of an attractor for those with paranoid delusions and psychosis, in part because we were willing to take in such people with few questions asked. They all failed the tests that Uther had developed -- not the screening that I gave you, but a simpler set of questions."</Masters>

<Juniper>"Why did you keep it going?"</Juniper> I asked.

<Masters>"Uther returned,"</Masters> said Masters. <Masters>"He seemed unconcerned by the fact that there was no recurrence of the phenomenon. He brought entads with him, the Orb of Knowledge, the Mirror of Messages, the armor that I now wear, and a new command."</Masters> Masters looked to me. <Masters>"He told me that I was to keep up the pretense of there being dream-skewered for the rest of my natural life. Two or three every year should be sufficient, he said, some of them pulled from the ranks of the insane, others invented from whole cloth. The endowment would last in perpetuity. He gave me instructions that I should follow. Lies I would need to tell."</Masters> He shook his head slightly. <Masters>"I balked. The rest of my natural life, when I might live another few millennia? I agreed to twenty years, because he was Uther Penndraig, and he seemed to think it was incredibly important. After he disappeared, I decided to stay on longer."</Masters>

I stepped forward, until I was standing in front of the mirror.

Uther appeared in the reflection, standing five feet away from the surface of the mirror. He was looking out at the middle distance, likely looking at a reflection of himself. I placed myself so his eyes were on me. My own reflection was absent from the mirror. He wasn't saying anything, but I could see the movement of his chest as he breathed.

I say Uther, because it was a far cry from Arthur as I'd known him. He was tall, well-muscled, with his facial features more defined than they'd been on Earth. He was older too. I would have guessed thirties, if not older. He had the same nose though, the same color eyes, and curly hair that was grown out, here less of an affectation, more of a kingly mane. He hadn't had a beard at sixteen though. He'd always joked that he couldn't grow one. He was dressed more simply than I would have expected of a king, nothing but a doublet, breeches, and heavy boots.

<Uther>"I often wonder â€¦"</Uther> he began, then stopped himself. <Uther>"I wonder what it would have been like to fall into a world that I didn't know. Something novel, rather than recycled. I wonder whether I would have believed in it more, if I hadn't seen your fingerprints all over everything. I wonder."</Uther> He paused. <Uther>"I wonder whether I could have forgotten Earth, with time, if there weren't so many reminders of the place I'd come from. Little jokes, little references, anagrams here and there, hints and clues that the world wasn't what it seemed. People wearing the faces of my old friends. Fleshed out versions of characters we'd had for a handful of sessions."</Uther>

He stopped again. He wasn't quite looking at me. I waved my hand slightly, but there was no reaction. I hadn't thought there would be.

<Uther>"So, if you're listening to this, then you're here. There's a decent chance that I'm still alive. If I am, I imagine that I'll find you soon enough. If I'm dead, which I might be, then it's likely that you're on your own narrative path, may God have mercy on your soul."</Uther> He let out a sigh. <Uther>"You'll have noticed, by now. I'm not sure about the others, but you? You'll have figured things out. The coincidences, the improbabilities, the way that things seem to fit just right, character arcs that are completed in the final seconds of the last battle. I don't know how much of my biography you'll have read, or how much you'll have learned about me, but if you don't see the patterns in your own life, I'm sure you'll see them in mine. Looking back, it all seems so trite. So many NPCs with their sob stories, so many love interests, paraded around in front of me before their inevitable deaths. I'll admit to being affected, at first."</Uther>

He shook his head slightly. <Uther>"And if you're here, watching this, then you're in it too. If it had to be anyone, Joon, I'm glad that it was you. You'll know this world better than I ever did, I think. There are things on Aerb that were only hinted at briefly in your campaigns, and I imagine there must be secrets that only you can unlock, words of power written down on your yellow legal pad that never made it to our ears. Maybe together, we can find a way back home. If I'm dead, then maybe you can find a way back on your own. Think back to the campaigns, try to visualize the magic items and the magics."</Uther> His eyes had grown a bit wider, his look intense. <Uther>"If you come up short, think about what you would have done, how you would have made it in order to fit with the aesthetic of this place. Think about something that would have the stink of Joon on it, that's where the answer will come from."</Uther>

Uther backed away slightly. He brought his hand up to his mouth and rubbed at his beard. <Uther>"I don't know what this place is,"</Uther> he said. <Uther>"It's not reality. I hope that you never get this message, because if you do, then it means that you're here. I'm leaving it for you anyway."</Uther> He gave a hollow laugh. <Uther>"There's so much I want to say to you. When I first heard of the dream-skewered, I thought that they would be all my old friends from -- from Kansas. I haven't said that word in a long time."</Uther> His face had fallen. His eyes were unfocused. <Uther>"But no, they were nobodies, a teenage girl from medieval France, an idiot teenager who had been in the middle of the Civil War, disparate times and places, nothing obviously relevant to me. It took me some time to see the narrative purpose of them. They were a temptation from the path of heroism, an invitation to indulge in the past, or maybe a call to remember who I was and what I was doing. I've done a fair job at resisting those temptations, or at least cloaking them in the guise of art or work. You've seen some of that, I'm sure."</Uther>

Uther stretched slightly, drawing himself to his full height. He was tall, taller than I was, and I'd gained a few inches as the game had added onto my physique. Uther was an intimidating man. I'd known that, but I'd underestimated the extent.

<Uther>"This is the closest that I've ever come to telling anyone on Aerb where I'm really from,"</Uther> he said. <Uther>"Sitting behind uncrackable wards, with a mirror I spent three weeks testing â€¦ I sometimes wonder why I bother with maintaining the silence. My peculiar form of insanity would cost me political power if it were known to the public, certainly, but my knights? My wife and children? Perhaps I feel like saying it out loud would take the story in some unexpected direction I'm not prepared to handle. I've been playing the part of Uther Penndraig for over two decades now, and I've gotten good at it. To go back to being Arthur again, to talk about the past with someone â€¦ well, I suppose this is what this message has become. I should be giving you warnings, I suppose, or secret histories, but either the narrative here is that this is a flight of fancy and a final send-off for the past I knew, or this is the narrative thread that draws you into the web. None of it really matters anyway."</Uther>

He looked like he was going to say more, but instead a slight frown crossed his face, and his reflection disappeared, leaving me to look at myself in the mirror. I turned toward the others, who were all watching me.

<Juniper>"Yeah,"</Juniper> I said. <Juniper>"It was meant for me."</Juniper> I looked at Masters. <Juniper>"I'm not sure how much I should say. I â€¦ don't really know you."</Juniper> I was sure there was a more diplomatic way of putting it, but I was in a bit of shell-shock. I hadn't started the day thinking that I would see Arthur again, even if it was just in a recording. He was so â€¦ different. After talking with Bethel, I had known he would be, but it was different, in the flesh.

<Amaryllis>"Scenario?"</Amaryllis> asked Amaryllis.

<Juniper>"Zero,"</Juniper> I replied. I looked at Masters again. <Juniper>"He said that if he was alive, he would see me shortly,"</Juniper> I said. <Juniper>"Do you have any idea what that means?"</Juniper>

<Masters>"I was given an entad to contact him with, a candle he said would light his way back to me,"</Masters> said Masters. <Masters>"I used it four hundred and fifty years ago, during the time of the Internecine Wars. There was no response, nor has there been one in all that time. The candle has continued to burn, to no effect."</Masters> He hesitated. <Masters>"Please, if you could just â€¦ if you could tell me anything, who you are, who he was, the connection between the two of you, anything, I've spent five hundred years in loyal service, with your name on a list written by Uther himself. Please."</Masters>

I glanced at Valencia, who gave me a barely perceptible nod. I was relieved that she hadn't hesitated.

<Juniper>"You said that this place had powerful magic,"</Juniper> I replied. <Juniper>"Tell me what it was, and I'll tell you some of what I know, enough to sate your curiosity."</Juniper>

<Masters>"Curiosity?"</Masters> asked Masters. His eyes were wide. <Masters>"The fate of the universe is at stake."</Masters>

<Juniper>"Explain,"</Juniper> I said. My mouth was set into a thin line. I wanted time to process, instead of being confronted by another crisis. If dream-skewered didn't exist, then we didn't need to worry as much about the Cannibal. I was really skeptical that this was going to end with us going home.

<Masters>"The threats escalated during Uther's time on Aerb,"</Masters> said Masters. <Masters>"In the years before he disappeared, they were enormous, bigger than was ever let on to the general public. They were tied to him, in some way, attracted to him with something like luck. It was joked that the world would have ended a hundred times over without him around. When he went missing, that joke stopped being funny. There were horrors lurking, entities waiting, and we had to fight them tooth and nail, losing people with every one we put down."</Masters> He was rubbing his hands together. <Masters>"The world settled down, eventually, at great cost, and the exclusions have helped with more than one of our collective problems in the time since, but â€¦"</Masters> He stopped and stared at me. <Masters>"Things have been heating back up."</Masters>

<Amaryllis>"Which powers?"</Amaryllis> asked Amaryllis. <Amaryllis>"How recently?"</Amaryllis>

Masters turned to look at her. She was still fully armored, which meant she gave even less away than usual. <Masters>"The Void Beast has started moving again, the Outer Reaches are no longer dormant, the Infinite Library is down to five years, Celestar is thrumming with renewed power, a raiding party from the Other Side crashed against the Gates of Leron three weeks ago, and there's reportedly something new that has the minions of the hells living in abject fear."</Masters> Masters looked back at me. <Masters>"How strong are you? You said you've been on Aerb for months?"</Masters>

<Juniper>"Back up,"</Juniper> I said. <Juniper>"I didn't understand half of what you just said."</Juniper>

<Masters>"Then tell me everything,"</Masters> said Masters. He had shaken some of his weariness, but I didn't like what had replaced it. It wasn't quite mania, but it was close. <Masters>"If you knew Uther, if you can get to him, or if you can act in his stead, with the same utter power that he wielded, then there are allies ready and waiting for you to call on. There are things you'll need to know."</Masters>

I stared at him. <Juniper>"Uther Penndraig was, himself, dream-skewered,"</Juniper> I said. <Juniper>"Earth isn't a delusion, nor a dream, it's a real place. It's a place that I'm from. Uther was â€¦ a friend. If I had to take a guess about where Uther went â€¦ I guess I would say that he went home, back to Earth. He said as much in the message he left for me, not that he was going back, but that he was looking for a way."</Juniper> He'd mentioned narrative too much; that was the framing he'd put on almost everything. I left that out.

<Amaryllis>"Tell us about the magic around this place,"</Amaryllis> said Amaryllis. <Amaryllis>"Tell us how you kept up the deception."</Amaryllis>

<Masters>"The Athenaeum of Speculation and Scrutiny was moved, at Uther's behest, specifically to be located within an exclusion zone. It's a well-guarded secret."</Masters> Masters shook his head. <Masters>"I won't say more."</Masters>

I stared at him. <Juniper>"Which one?"</Juniper> I asked.

<Masters>"Not one known to you,"</Masters> said Masters. <Masters>"Silent exclusions, Uther called them. A part of my work here, with the others, is keeping that secret contained. I'm one of three."</Masters>

<Juniper>"You're all waiting here for him to return?"</Juniper> I asked.

<Masters>"No,"</Masters> said Masters. <Masters>"Waiting for him ... or for you, if you're like him. You must have read his writings, if you've already gathered your knights. Have you not realized the common thread of chosen heroes answering the Call?"</Masters>

Something felt off. Maybe it was the understanding that this man was, by his own admission, a master mage at the top of his game, or maybe it was that the message from Uther had contained too much, too fast. Uther had many allies; I'd known that. To be speaking with one now made me start thinking about what enemies he might have left behind.

<Juniper>"Grak, Val, Fenn, status?"</Juniper> I asked.

<Grak>"No changes,"
