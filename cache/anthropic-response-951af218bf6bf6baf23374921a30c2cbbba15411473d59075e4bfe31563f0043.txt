<Valencia>"It is incredibly unprofessional for him to ask you on a date,"</Valencia>

<Valencia>"Well I was the one to ask him,"</Valencia> <Valencia>"Because I knew that he wouldn't have asked me on his own."</Valencia>

<Amaryllis>"Oh,"</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"It's still incredibly unprofessional for him to accept."</Amaryllis>

<Solace>"I think it's nice,"</Solace> <Solace>"He seems like a very safe choice for you to experiment with courtship."</Solace>

<Valencia>"Thank you, Solace,"</Valencia> <Valencia>"I didn't say it because I wanted anyone to weigh in, I said it because I wanted to share something important that was happening in my life."</Valencia>

<Amaryllis>"Did you ask him with a devil's skills at manipulation?"</Amaryllis>

<Valencia>"No,"</Valencia>

<Fenn>"That really wasn't a convincing no,"</Fenn>

<Valencia>"I took in a devil to see what I would say,"</Valencia> <Valencia>"And then a few more to get second opinions. But when I asked him, it was just me, with my own words. They were only giving advice."</Valencia>

<Fenn>"Seems sketchy,"</Fenn>

<Valencia>"I didn't want to screw it up."</Valencia>

<Amaryllis>"There are things that he can't know,"</Amaryllis>

<Valencia>"I know,"</Valencia>

<Grak>"What do you two talk about?"</Grak>

<Fenn>"Harry Potter,"</Fenn>

<Valencia>"We talk about other things,"</Valencia> <Valencia>"It's good, isn't it?"</Valencia>

<Fenn>"It is,"</Fenn> <Fenn>"Though some things get lost in translation, and some of it I'm sure Amaryllis would rail against as being bigotry."</Fenn> <Fenn>"Greedy goblins, for example."</Fenn>

<Amaryllis>"You have to make a distinction between the traits of a culture and a species,"</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"You don't say that goblins are greedy, you don't say that goblins focus on possession of written information, you instead say that historically their society has been dominated by warring gold mages and a veneration of wealth, and that currently, the Kel'e'thar Library engages in some practices which, yes, might contain some elements of greed."</Amaryllis>

<Fenn>"Jesus that's a mouthful,"</Fenn>

<Amaryllis>"Don't take the Lord's name in vain,"</Amaryllis>

<Valencia>"I like Mrs. Rowling's goblins better than Juniper's,"</Valencia> <Valencia>"No offense, Juniper."</Valencia>

<Juniper>"I'd really hesitate to call them mine,"</Juniper> <Juniper>"Everything on Aerb is kind of … twisted, warped, different in different ways, and some of it was just me being silly or making jokes."</Juniper>

<Fenn>"Yeah, Aerb goblins suck,"</Fenn>

<Amaryllis>"Please never say anything like that in public,"</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"You're a government official now."</Amaryllis>

<Fenn>"I shall continue to hide and vote how you tell me to vote,"</Fenn> <Fenn>"And I'll wait for the next proper adventure we all know is coming."</Fenn>

<Grak>"I itch to have something to do,"</Grak>

<Amaryllis>"After the first round of tuunglings is born, we'll have some time to breathe,"</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"My engineers are already hard at work, not entirely autonomous at this point, but close enough that I could leave them for a week."</Amaryllis>

<Fenn>"Maybe I'll stay back this time,"</Fenn> <Fenn>"Catch some sun, watch some anime, not get shot at or cut in half, that kind of thing."</Fenn>

<Grak>"My hand was cut off,"</Grak> <Grak>"I did not complain."</Grak>

<Valencia>"If my hand was cut off it would be gone forever,"</Valencia>

<Amaryllis>"Technically we could ice it and then use surgery to reattach, along with Earth antibiotics and medicines in order to ensure that it would heal properly,"</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"But you'd be out of action for a very long time, even if the surgery was successful."</Amaryllis>

<Fenn>"Wouldn't you just use some ninjutsu to dodge the attack?"</Fenn>

<Valencia>"Not all fights are possible to win without getting hurt,"</Valencia>

<Fenn>"Well, you've been kicking my fucking ass when we spar, I'll give you that,"</Fenn>

<Grak>"I would vote for Glassy Fields,"</Grak>

<Valencia>"No more votes,"</Valencia>

<Fenn>"Can't we rest on our laurels?"</Fenn> <Fenn>"Besides, we haven't even gotten our campaign of Arches back up and running."</Fenn>

<Juniper>"We've been resting on our laurels,"</Juniper> <Juniper>"It's true. Amaryllis has been the only one actually doing much work."</Juniper>

<Amaryllis>"There's enough work for whoever wants it,"</Amaryllis>

<Solace>"I've been tending to the locus and attempting to restore my connection to the flowers of my garden,"</Solace> <Solace>"I do think that I deserve a bit of rest."</Solace> <Solace>"Were we comparing things that we hadn't complained about? I did die, after all."</Solace>

<Fenn>"Well, you did get better,"</Fenn>

<Juniper>"I didn't mean to say that we didn't deserve a break, or that the relative downtime --"</Juniper>

<Amaryllis>"No, stop. No one say another fucking word,"</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"Infohazard. Don't speak without thinking about every single word coming out of your mouth, no nouns, keep yourself to the most common hundred words in Anglish."</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"We need to go to war footing, there's a sixty percent chance that most of us will be dead in the next hour, start getting armored up, now. Quickly."</Amaryllis>

<Amaryllis>"Barriers won't work,"</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"Wards won't work. Obstructions won't work, raw killing power won't work, magic will be shrugged off or only partially successful, no known entad can stop him, and he scales to any threats. On the first invocation of the word there's a sixty percent chance he'll appear, and if he does we're absolutely fucked -- no Juniper, don't write anything down."</Amaryllis>

<Juniper>"Can … I … think?"</Juniper>

<Amaryllis>"Think all you want,"</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"Maintain protocol for speech, no writing whatsoever."</Amaryllis>

<Amaryllis>"Sixty percent he comes, forty percent he doesn't,"</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"I'll explain after, if I can."</Amaryllis>

<Juniper>"You've come up to Craig's cabin for the weekend, prepared for a night of gaming, but not knowing the horrible fate that awaits you,"</Juniper>

<Craig>"Spooky,"</Craig>

<Juniper>"It is spooky,"</Juniper> <Juniper>"There have been little things, little signs, the old man who issued you a word of warning at the gas station, a blood-smeared sign you passed by on the dirt road, which you told yourselves was just roadkill, the sound the radio made when you turned it on that seemed very much like a pained scream before the radio shorted out."</Juniper> <Juniper>"But you've almost managed to forget all the foreboding and have settled in for a night enjoying each other's company. The fireplace crackles beside you. Suddenly, your idle conversation is interrupted when one of the windows rattles,"</Juniper>

<Tiff>"Must have been the wind?"</Tiff>

<Juniper>"Might have been,"</Juniper>

<Arthur>"Anyway, as I was saying,"</Arthur> <Arthur>"My father got me this neat book full of Aramaic, and I was going to try to read some of it."</Arthur>

<Reimer>"Can I be armed?"</Reimer>

<Juniper>"Wouldn't do you any good,"</Juniper>

<Reimer>"Really?"</Reimer>

<Tiff>"Just get into the genre, Reimer,"</Tiff> <Tiff>"Horror movie rules. A gun is never enough, he's supernatural. You go to a phone, the line is dead. You reach a policeman sitting in his car, you're going to discover that his throat has been slit."</Tiff>

<Arthur>"Wait,"</Arthur> <Arthur>"Forget the book of Aramaic, I'm going to the bathroom."</Arthur>

<Juniper>"The bathroom?"</Juniper>

<Arthur>"We're away from civilization in a run-down cabin,"</Arthur> <Arthur>"It's a dark and stormy night."</Arthur>

<Juniper>"Sure,"</Juniper>

<Arthur>"I want to start this right,"</Arthur> <Arthur>"I stand in front of the mirror, I close my eyes. I say it slowly, getting faster each time. Shia LaBeouf, Shia LaBeouf, Shia LaBeouf! Does anything happen?"</Arthur>

<Juniper>"You open your eyes?"</Juniper>

<Arthur>"I do,"</Arthur>

<Juniper>"He's standing behind you, fully naked, his beard drenched in blood,"</Juniper>

<Amaryllis>"We don't know if it's a name, or just a word,"</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"Joon? Name or word?"</Amaryllis>

<Juniper>"Name,"</Juniper>

<Amaryllis>"If you invoke it, a man shows up,"</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"Not all the time. Sixty percent, maybe."</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"If you invoke it three times, you guarantee his arrival."</Amaryllis>

<Grak>"And then?"</Grak>

<Amaryllis>"He starts killing,"</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"Sometimes dozens, sometimes hundreds. It depends on who's around. He's arbitrarily strong. He moves as fast as he needs to. Anything you put in front of him, he'll grow a new power to tear down or go around."</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"I think if he were coming, he would have. We can stand down."</Amaryllis>

<Juniper>"To be clear,"</Juniper> <Juniper>"It was the name after --"</Juniper>

<Amaryllis>"No,"</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"Don't repeat anything. I'll do it. You said 'actual' then 'cannibal' and then the name. Don't speak it, don't spell it, don't write it, don't try putting it in code, don't knowingly transmit it to anyone else, in whole or in part, through any medium or any level of cryptography."</Amaryllis>

<Juniper>"Okay,"</Juniper> <Juniper>"How much of that is,"</Juniper> <Juniper>"too much caution?"</Juniper>

<Amaryllis>"None of it is paranoia,"</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"We've tried to harness him in the past. It always ends with everyone dying."</Amaryllis>

<Juniper>"If you were able to transmit it to someone, somehow,"</Juniper> <Juniper>"Have them say it, weaponize it? Suicide bombers?"</Juniper>

<Amaryllis>"Your suicidal agent would die,"</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"Any means of protecting them or bringing them back would fail. Then he would go after whoever told the agent the word, and whoever gave the order, even if they didn't know the word. Five of my cousins died in that particular experiment. It's not something that anyone can actually use, except as an absolute last resort when all you want to do is call down extreme violence on yourself and everyone else in the area."</Amaryllis>

<Fenn>"Is Joon in danger now?"</Fenn> <Fenn>"If any of us say it, this thing will kill him too, even if he's nowhere close?"</Fenn>

<Amaryllis>"Yes,"</Amaryllis>

<Juniper>"Fuck,"</Juniper>

<Amaryllis>"I heard it from a phonograph playing in the middle of nowhere on a loop, recorded by a dead man who had heard it from others who were also dead,"</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"That's the only safe way to learn it."</Amaryllis>

<Juniper>"Wait,"</Juniper> <Juniper>"Writing triggers it?"</Juniper> <Juniper>"We have to stop using the backpack. We can't pull movies from out of it, at least not ones from after 1990, and … shit, we can't use IMDB, or printouts from websites that might list actors. I don't know if that would twig it, but --"</Juniper>

<Amaryllis>"Movies?"</Amaryllis>

<Juniper>"The name,"</Juniper> <Juniper>"It belongs to an actor from Earth."</Juniper>

<Amaryllis>"What."</Amaryllis>

<Juniper>"He was a child actor, became a movie star, now … kind of a meme, I guess,"</Juniper>

<Amaryllis>"Juniper, you confirmed that there weren't infohazards on Earth,"</Amaryllis>

<Juniper>"No,"</Juniper> <Juniper>"A meme, just … not making fun of him, exactly, because he invited a lot of it on himself, and I think he knew what he was doing, but the idea of him was bigger than the reality? And there was this video,"</Juniper> <Juniper>"which I guess I can't say the name of, but the joke was that he was a kind of weird Hollywood actor being portrayed as a horror movie monster. It wasn't horrifying, really, it was the juxtaposition. It was a joke. And then someone made it into a rules-light game that you could play with no prep and sixty seconds to make characters."</Juniper> <Juniper>"We only played it two or three times, it was supposed to be campy, not …"</Juniper> <Juniper>"I had no idea he existed on Aerb. You're not supposed to be able to summon him, not in the base rules, that was just something Arthur came up with, an improvisation. I mean, one that fit well within the theme of the game, but still."</Juniper>

<Juniper>"Look,"</Juniper> <Juniper>"It's fine. We're past the moment of danger, right?"</Juniper>

<Amaryllis>"Maybe,"</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"Probably."</Amaryllis>

<Juniper>"And now that I know, I can avoid it,"</Juniper>

<Fenn>"You could have told us beforehand,"</Fenn>

<Amaryllis>"Oh, yes,"</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"That's a fucking brilliant idea, spreading knowledge of things that are dangerous to know and even more dangerous to say, and which might literally kill me if spoken by someone else. Why did I not think to tell you, of all people?"</Amaryllis>

<Fenn>"I love when you get snarky,"</Fenn> <Fenn>"So are we going to play a game of Actual Cannibal --"</Fenn>

<Valencia>"She's licking me,"</Valencia>

<Juniper>"I think she was probably making a joke,"</Juniper> <Juniper>"She wasn't actually going to say it."</Juniper>

<Amaryllis>"Not a thing that anyone should joke about,"</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"It's a word -- name that's killed thousands."</Amaryllis>

<Grak>"How many of those because you tried to weaponize it?"</Grak>

<Valencia>"I'm going to let her up now,"</Valencia>

<Fenn>"I obviously wasn't going to say it,"</Fenn> <Fenn>"If we can't joke about things trying to kill us, what can we joke about?"</Fenn>

<Grak>"Puns,"</Grak>

<Amaryllis>"I think I'm done for the day,"</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"I'll be in the study if anyone needs me."</Amaryllis>

<Juniper>"I think I'm done too, sorry,"</Juniper> <Juniper>"That was, uh, sort of an unpleasant reminder of what kind of world this is."</Juniper>

<Juniper>"Come in,"</Juniper>

<Juniper>"Just wanted company?"</Juniper>

<Amaryllis>"No,"</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"I think what just happened was a warning."</Amaryllis>

<Juniper>"Maybe,"</Juniper> <Juniper>"A warning from the Dungeon Master that if we sit around doing nothing, adventure will come to us?"</Juniper>

<Amaryllis>"I don't know,"</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"Something like that."</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"I know you don't want to level up again. It's something we should talk about more. You didn't tell me how bad it was the time before, when it was just you and Fenn. You had two and a half months and you just ignored it, like it was going to go away on its own. I should have asked, but I just … I thought you had it under control."</Amaryllis>

<Juniper>"I don't understand the point of the pleasure,"</Juniper> <Juniper>"If you were an idiot, you'd think that it was a good way to compel me to go adventuring more, to complete quests, to kill things … but I was given the resources to alter myself early on, and if you were literally omniscient, then you'd have to understand that I would be horrified by the idea of losing myself to an impulse to become stronger. Right? I've got a disincentive to pursue leveling up now."</Juniper>

<Amaryllis>"It's terrible game design,"</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"But we need you to level up."</Amaryllis>

<Juniper>"There are things that only I can do,"</Juniper> <Juniper>"I know. I don't want to lose myself though. I don't want my identity to be stripped away, not more than it already has been. The levels have been getting further apart, but they're ramping up in intensity. If you hadn't been there ..."</Juniper>

<Amaryllis>"I know,"</Amaryllis> <Amaryllis>"You want to refuse the call."</Amaryllis>
