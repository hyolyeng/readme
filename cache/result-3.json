I'm pretty sure that this is one of those things.

She had expressed a strong preference for being a house, and had spent the last few weeks filling herself with all sorts of crap that couldn't easily be moved. For her to come with would mean taking everything that wasn't 'house' and tossing it out onto the ground, or alternately, having someone go around with the glove and hoover up everything from every room. For what was planned as a day trip, and one where we probably wouldn't need overwhelming firepower, that didn't seem worth it.\n\nGranted, we were still loaded for bear and treating this as though it were a military operation, because the most important thing we'd learned about quests so far was that they could be as difficult and complicated as they wanted to be. We were going there for two quests, one the Shia LaBeouf quest, the other Straddling Worlds, which had been in my quest log since my very first day on Aerb. Both seemed easy, which was suspicious, but at least the dream-skewered quest had been given to me when I was level two. You weren't supposed to get incredibly difficult quests at level two, you were supposed to get the first quest in a long chain that you would eventually be able to handle with another dozen levels under your belt. I expected more quests to follow.\n\nWe gathered together our things, armored up, checked our weapons over, made sure that the glove was stocked. I felt a little outclassed by Valencia and Amaryllis, given that they were both covered head-to-toe in full plate and decked out with weapons. Bethel had made sheaths, pouches, and in some cases, clothes, pulling things from Earth with precision and making the necessary alterations.\n\nGiven that the Anyblade was gone, I was using the shortsword we'd taken from Aumann's vault, ages ago. Bethel could speak considerably faster than any of us, and focus intently on a single task without growing bored (at the exclusion of everything else), so she'd launched a dictionary attack on it, trying to find out whether it had a code phrase that we just didn't know. That had turned out to be the case: it was \"smoke\". When spoken, the bluish-silver blade would go black, and it gained the ability to pass through metal for a few seconds before reverting to normal. It could do this once a day, which was entirely underwhelming, especially given that Amaryllis had the flicker-blade which could do the same thing, but better and more often. I had bonded to the shortsword anyhow, since it was better than nothing, and I still wanted to be able to use my blade-bound powers.\n\nI had a rifle strapped to my back, in order to give me some range. It wasn't magical or anything, but it was the best we had, unless I wanted to use a bow and arrow. As good as I was with a bow, largely thanks to Fenn, I still favored the rifle, in part because I didn't have a fancy 'quiver' like she did to give me near-infinite ammo in easy reach.\n\nI wore bandoliers, mostly filled with bones, in part to give cover to the technique that I was using, which by imperial law, I wasn't supposed to have. Amaryllis was working on squaring everything away as far as legality was concerned, but that was a work in progress, and it was likely going to require some amount of legal recognition of our tiny nation. Once that was all done, we could reveal a little bit more of our true abilities, but as of right now, we were completely unlicensed soul mages working for what was only really a nation because of our pretensions and the backing of polities like the Ha-lunde.\n\nAmaryllis was very clear that the rules of engagement had changed, and Jorge had been very clear that there were limits to what Uniquities was willing (or able) to cover for. If there was another fight in the streets like the last time we'd been to Boastre Vino, then at a minimum we would need to stick around and explain things to the authorities, which would open up our tiny nation to more scrutiny than it was already under.\n\nIn retrospect, maybe taking a fully-armed party of six in to complete a level 2 quest was tempting the narrative a bit too much.\n\nThe Dream That Skewers\n\nWhen looking at the athenaeum system as a whole, I was very much reminded about what Figaro Finch and I had talked about regarding specialized hammers. If all you had were thirteen special hammers, then eventually you would start designating some of them for 'close-enough' purposes. Each of the athenaeums had carved out their own little slice of the higher-education pie, and usually centered around one or two complementary or linked types of magic, but there was a strong tendency for them to expand beyond that. The Athenaeum of Bone and Flesh wasn't just a place where people learned bone magic, it was where they learned healing magic in general, and beyond that, they were the renowned experts in non-magical healing as well, save for the niche that the Athenaeum of Quills and Blood had carved out for itself. There were things you could learn without going to one of the athenaeums, since Aerb also had independent colleges, and not all of the minor magics were tightly regulated ... but anyone who wanted to be someone in academics or magic needed to go to an athenaeum.\n\nSpeculation and Scrutiny was, in many respects, the junk drawer of the athenaeum system. They were the 'hey, that's weird ...' athenaeum, the place that studied all those little bits and bobs that people wanted to fully understand. Speculation and Scrutiny was divided up into colleges with their own subspecialties, one for entads, one for racial attributes and bloodline magics, one for 'dead' magics, one for Animalia, and so on and so forth. All in all, it was a long list of different things that were in need of study, with toes occasionally dipped into the waters that others had claimed. The dream-skewered were a part of the Cerebral College, with a small dormitory tucked away on the mountaintop campus. That was our destination.\n\nGetting up the mountain from Boastre Vino was relatively easy; all we had to do was present temporary guest passes, which were given out fairly freely. Ours were forged, but there was no way to easily tell that. Much of the groundwork for our visit to Speculation and Scrutiny had been laid the last time we were in Boastre Vino; while Fenn and I had been busy with the unicorn stuff, the other members of the party had been getting some work done, and Amaryllis had put as much work as she could into all of the quests we had listed.\n\nThe trolley had seats for twenty, but we were the only ones on it. That wasn't a huge surprise; we'd picked a time of day that was well outside peak hours. Boastre Vino was less connected to the athenaeum than you might have thought, for two places that were so close to each other. Speculation and Scrutiny had their own mess halls, entertainment, and services, all of them with the fairly large advantage of not having to spend a forty minute round trip to get to them. People did go down to Boastre Vino, but it was usually to buy specialty things that they couldn't order by catalog, or to take in some sort of excitement that the athenaeum didn't have on offer.

The Athenaeum of Speculation and Scrutiny was one of the smaller athenaeums, which meant that it 'only' had a hundred thousand students, divided up into a handful of colleges. It was a hell of a lot of people even before you added in all the faculty and staff, all of them packed onto the tip of the mountain. The architecture followed a uniform aesthetic, with tall buildings, lots of terraces, and swirling bas-reliefs wherever there was a large expanse of wall. The air was a bit thin, enough to be noticeable, and we were far above the timberline, but someone had gone through the effort of making sure there was greenery, in the form of short grasses growing in stone beds, and more exotic plants that didn't have any leaves, instead looking like curled, waxy stalks.\n\n\"I think that I can explain as we walk, without revealing anything,\" said Solace. Her voice was higher, now that she was a child, but it still had the air of wisdom and age to it. \"Juniper has said that the great virtue of my kind is saxud, 'doublethink' in his parlance. The part I find enjoyable is in seeing how others react to having certain subjects which must be danced around, or certain thoughts that must not be thought.\"\n\n\"Is that what being a -- what being you is like?\" asked Valencia. She stopped herself from calling Solace a druid at the last moment.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" said Solace. \"Not often. It was difficult, when I was younger, but as I grew old, it became much simpler. Now, after that violent rebirth, I find myself closer to the true ideal of those in my vocation. Pieces of the old me have been cleaned from my soul.\"\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't talk like that,\" said Amaryllis.\n\n\"With happiness?\" asked Solace. She let out a little laugh. \"You're a very good mother, to be worried about me so.\"\n\nThe dream-skewered were kept in a combination dormitory, clinic, and research center. Last time we'd been in Boastre Vino, Amaryllis had gotten all of the information she'd thought we would need. This time, there wasn't a Larkspur to stop us. The dormitory was a four-story building, wider than it was tall, but with the same terraces and bas-reliefs of the other, taller buildings around it. It had a fifteen foot, solidly-built wall, with holes and arches at the top for decoration. It was the only building with a wall around it, and I noticed that everything decorative about it was above the height a person could reach, even if they were jumping. The main gates were thick iron, locked shut. For all the efforts the exterior made to make the place look inviting, it still had the air of institutional confinement to it. So far as I was aware, the dream-skewered were checked in voluntarily and stayed by their own decision, but ...\n\n\"There are heavy wards,\" said Grak. \"Heavier than on any other building on campus.\" He pointed up to the top floor. \"Annihilation wards, there. Instant death if you tried to enter or leave.\"\n\n\"Ominous,\" said Solace.\n\n\"Not instant death for everyone,\" said Amaryllis, glancing in Valencia's direction. Valencia was in the Red Armor of Arramor, completely covered, which would hide her from any warder, but it also made her look really fucking scary, especially because of the crown of thorns sitting on top of her helmet.\n\n\"There's an intercom,\" I said, pointing to a small box next to the gate.\n\n\"I want it on record that this is the most obvious trap in the world,\" said Fenn.\n\nI moved forward and gave the intercom button a press.

It didn't look like an evil lair of evil. We walked forward, on guard.\n\nWearing armor was frowned upon in polite society, but not so much that there were laws against it, or even so much that people would actually frown. There were a few features that were common for entad armor, including resizing, comfortability, breathability, and a host of others, which meant that armor wasn't always such a burden on people as it might have seemed, and that in turn meant that you couldn't just assume someone wearing full plate was getting ready for war. In addition to that, there were armors that provided useful, day-to-day utility for people, especially with regards to movement, and you wouldn't want to castigate someone for wearing armor that could spirit him across the city and let him skip his commute.\n\n(Added onto that was the question of money. Most entads ended up in the hands of the rich, through a couple of different mechanisms, and the rich tended to make the rules and set the fashions. Breastplates occasionally came into fashion as knock-offs or inspirations from some rich asshole being seen with a new entad, though the copycat armor was rarely functional. More often though, you'd see clothes cut or dyed such that they gave the impression of armor without any of the inconvenience.)\n\nWeapons were a little less defensible in polite society. Some had mundane utility, sure, but for every entad sword that healed people instead of hurting them, you had a hundred more that were just more effective instruments of murder. The social pressure against going around armed was stronger, and you would get a look or two, though it was unlikely that anyone would make a comment about it. Swords were more acceptable than guns, in part because of the implied level of training and knowledge. Either way, a weapon at the hip would draw attention, and that attention would be largely negative, but it wasn't anything you couldn't overcome with a smile and a friendly demeanor. The attention was the big worry; if you wanted to go around without attracting attention, then it was better to be dressed as simply and non-threateningly as possible.\n\nAnd then you had our little group of six. We hadn't made any attempt at hewing to cultural expectations. No, if we were going up against He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, we were going to be doing it as fully armed as we could possibly be, at least to within the limits of what was legal. Valencia had red armor with tiny thorns, a crown of thorns, a sword at her hip, and two pistols in their holsters. All that was intimidating, even before you knew that the crown ate poisons, the sword ate memories, and the girl inside the armor was absolutely insanely proficient at combat. Amaryllis was next-most-scarily equipped, and I think Solace was the only one of us who could have passed for unthreatening.\n\nA young man sat behind a counter in a reception area, looking a little too alert and straight-backed for my tastes, but that had to be the natural reaction of someone seeing so many heavily armed people come into the place."}, {"speaker": "Young_man", "text": "Ah,"}, {"speaker": "NARRATOR", "text": "he said, taking us in.

It wasn't the ideal trial run for coming out of the shadows, but it was the hand we'd been dealt. We were really hoping that there wasn't going to be an official investigation, but if there was, we really couldn't be operating as covert agents on foreign soil. That was not to mention the distinctive armor, weapons, and abilities, all of which had already been the giveaway for Uniquities. Going covert might have worked if we'd been willing to go in without weapons or armor, as we'd done when we hijacked the sky ship, but that seemed like asking for trouble here.)\n\nThe man who came down the elevator a few minutes later was wearing armor of his own, though nothing so ostentatious as what Valencia had on. His breastplate was semi-transparent and etched with the design of a tree in deep black. His shirt was an Earth-standard dress shirt though, and his black slacks and dress shoes weren't too far off from Earth fashions either.
