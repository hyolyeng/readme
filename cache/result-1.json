The need would get worse and worse, becoming a distraction and eventually a compulsion, until something had to be done about it. For dwarves, it was somewhat the opposite; a dwarf was never overcome with need, or even really experienced more than a shade of it, not unless there was some physical stimulus. Instead, sex tended to be something that dwarves engaged in only for the purposes of procreation, though as a parthenogenetic species, they didn't even need that. Dwarves found the actual physical process highly enjoyable, but there was never much element of compulsion to it, and they would rarely seek it out.\n\nDing shifted his position on the couch, and joked that maybe the next time he was having trouble with his studies because he needed relief, he would ask Grak for some help. It wasn't really a joke though ... and Grak wasn't at all averse.\n\nGrak spent a long time explaining this to me, all in Groglir, while I strained to keep up and interjected occasionally in order to get clarifications on sentence construction and vocabulary."}, {"speaker": "Grak", "text": "I had not known what would await me in the world outside of Darili Irid, only that I wanted it,"}, {"speaker": "NARRATOR", "text": "said Grak."}, {"speaker": "Grak", "text": "I had always found the dwarfhold too small, too ordered, too limited, even though I loved and honored Darili Irid.

'Krin' was someone you were physically intimate with, often to the level of sharing a bed naked with them, and 'krinrael' was that, but much more temporary, not an ongoing arrangement. It didn't imply that you were dating, or that you even talked all that much, but it often was a stepping stone to more intimate or contractual arrangements, like the dwarven version of marriage and/or pair-breeding. You could have more than one krin, but it wasn't particularly common. There was some element of (or at least some suggestion toward) sex, but dwarves didn't place all that much emphasis on sex, and it wasn't what a dwarf would think of when they thought of krin.)"}, {"speaker": "Joon", "text": "You were not that to him?"}, {"speaker": "NARRATOR", "text": "I asked.\n\nGrak shook his head."}, {"speaker": "Grak", "text": "When the act was done he had no interest,"}, {"speaker": "NARRATOR", "text": "said Grak."}, {"speaker": "Grak", "text": "A switch had been flipped.

From a certain point of view, Ding fit in with the heroic archetypes common among kle'tan. He wasn't an explorer or adventurer, but he bravely sought out new and exciting things for them to try as a group, and he was cosmopolitan in a way that all the best kle'tan heroes were. Naturally, she had a crush on him.\n\nI kind of liked hearing Grak relive all of this ancient drama.

Put in that context ... there had been an explosion in China, some kind of factory, killing thousands, and all I could vaguely recall was watching a video on Youtube that had synced the views from different cameras. And there had been a stampede in Mecca, hadn't there? Thousands of people crushed to death, and I probably only remembered it happening because I loved the worldbuilding aspects of giant pilgrimage sites. That helped me to put it into context, a bit.

He was crying more now, sobbing, overwhelmed. I shifted in my seat on the floor for just a bit, then moved over and put my arm around him, patting him gently on the back. He leaned into me, and rested his head on my shoulder as he cried. It was a bit awkward, but I'd never had someone cry on me and not had it feel like that.\n\nSo many things about Grak were coming into focus for me, different things that he'd said or done. His focus on the penance was on paying down some karmic debt, and it wasn't actually about the gold, it was about ensuring that he was staying on that path. Fenn had called us all suicidal on more than one occasion, but along with what Amaryllis had said to him at the hospital, I got the impression that was literally true. He blamed himself for what had happened, and there was no way to ever make it right, but he was devoting himself to the pursuit of restoring that karmic debt, throwing himself into situations where death was a possibility.\n\nI'd seen Grak injured a few times, some of them pretty serious. I'd always thought his flat reaction was just dwarven stubbornness in the face of injury, a gruff, manly response to getting hurt. That was sort of how I had seen him in general, a man unaffected by the world, stoic in the face of adversity. It hadn't really occurred to me that he was depressed and waiting to die.\n\nWe held our hug for a long time.\n\nI wanted to tell him that I understood. In the depths of my depression, every scrap of happiness I'd somehow managed to secure felt like it was a betrayal of Arthur's memory, a dagger planted in his back. I'd driven people away because I didn't think that I deserved them. I had so much anger and sadness, feeding into each other, that the world seemed like it had nothing to offer me. I hadn't cared whether I'd lived or died, and then when I hit bottom, as low as I could go ...\n\nI tried to kill myself.\n\nI didn't say this to Grak. It wasn't something that I had said out loud yet. I was worried that he would think I was making things up about myself, or that he was only looking for comfort, not for us to relate to one another, or that I had misread what he was doing with the penance.\n\nThe more I thought about it though, the more I thought that was just me making up excuses to cover the real reason. I didn't want to say it because it was painful to say, and I thought that he would think less of me for it, or at least think differently about me. It wasn't something that I had told Fenn or Amaryllis. I didn't want to expose the weakness of trying to take the easy way out, nor the weakness of not being able to follow through on it. I'd been pretty successful in not so much as thinking about it.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Grak.\n\n\"We are here for you,\" I said. He pulled back slightly, and I released him from the hug. \"I know you know that. I know that ... that it probably feels like forging a new life for yourself is --\"\n\n\"Not possible,\" said Grak.\n\nQuest Updated: All That Glitters - Go with Grakhuil Leadbraids to the mausoleum of Darili Irid when he's amassed one thousand pounds of gold. You are the only one who can help him make peace. (517/1000) (Companion Quest)\n\nI stayed quiet. I wasn't actually sure that the quest was accurate, since they'd been inaccurate before. I had a hard time believing that I was the only one that could do it, given that social stuff was definitely not my forte, and I wasn't much of a real friend to Grak. He'd only confided in me because ... well, that was a question mark, and I didn't know him well enough to say.

Grak was his own person, he wanted to be his own person, finding us and becoming a part of the Council of Arches, heart and soul, was, in his eyes, sort of a betrayal of the person he thought of himself as being. All I was really doing was increasing that tension, without actually helping to ease or resolve it.

Essentially, if you have a body of work built up, that engenders expectations, and in the context of an audience's reaction to narrative --\"\n\n\"Snooze, pass, I'm done with it,\" said Fenn. She rolled her eyes at Amaryllis' faint frown. \"Look, I'm sorry if you find it interesting or worth spending time on, but unless it's actually going to help us in some way, I don't give a crap, and I don't think anyone else should either.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" said Amaryllis with a shrug. \"But you should know that it was a really interesting point.\"\n\n\"I'll put it on my internal scoreboard,\" said Fenn with a smile.\n\n\"Is this how you two are when you're alone together?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, exactly like that,\" said Fenn. \"But usually we're naked and having a pillow fight while we talk.\"\n\n\"She does that with you too?\" asked Valencia.\n\nFenn stopped and looked at Valencia, who was doing an absolute pitch-perfect job of showing confused innocence. I couldn't stop myself from laughing.\n\n\"Are you using a devil to sell the joke?\" asked Amaryllis with a frown.\n\nValencia held up her thumb and forefinger, half an inch apart from each other.\n\n\"Well, it was funny, I'll give you that,\" said Fenn.\n\n\"You really need to stop doing that,\" said Amaryllis. \"If they find out what's happening, and trace it back to you, they have methods of influencing Aerb. The hells haven't been united since the time of the Apocalypse Demon, and the dent Uther put in our cosmology has helped ensure only the weak can make it up, but trillions of infernals unified again isn't really something that we should risk for a joke.\"\n\n\"I'll just kill them all,\" said Valencia. \"Jorge thinks that I should anyway.\"\n\n\"That sounds like exactly the sort of thing we should have a long talk about in the Council of Arches first,\" said Fenn. \"I don't think we included a clause about genocide in the charter, but maybe we should have.\"\n\n\"If we're going to do it, better we do it as quickly as possible,\" I said. Amaryllis glared at me. \"I'm just saying, if there are a trillion people in the hells, which there might be, and they're being ... I don't know, physically and psychologically tortured, then murdering all the devils and demons is probably the most possible good we can do, right?\"\n\n\"That's what Jorge said,\" replied Valencia.\n\n\"How many tendrils do you have?\" asked Amaryllis. \"Last I checked, it was seventeen, and it took you some time to move them around.\"\n\n\"I have more than ten thousand,\" said Valencia. \"But I'm close to my limit, for now, because there's starting to be a little strain. I was able to add more after Juniper leveled up.\"\n\nI hadn't really been keeping abreast of the research into Val's powers, on the thinking that Amaryllis wasn't likely to miss anything that I would catch. My attempts at putting some distance between Valencia and myself seemed to be working, at least as far as her attachment to me went. I knew that her sight into the hells was a bit limited, not enough for surveillance, though we had infernoscopes for that if we really needed, and if we didn't want to look at anything too far down. I also knew that the tendrils couldn't be used on people in hell, which had been one of my first questions; that, at least, would have been a no-brainer, whatever you thought about the wisdom of antagonizing the infernals.\n\nWe moved on to other topics, and went through a few cycles of testing weapons and armor for Valencia. The game had termed her Valencia the Red, and as it turned out, the Red Armor of Arramor worked perfectly on her, which was a little bit on the nose. There were different methods that armor used to shape itself to a person, and the Red Armor of Arramor used the method that would have worked on a sack of potatoes; conforming to whatever was placed inside it and hoping that the joints would work out on their own. There were different methods of reducing damage, or even knowing what damage was, and the Red Armor of Arramor used the method that would have worked on a sack of potatoes, stopping 'incoming' kinetic energy with respect to itself if preset thresholds were exceeded. And finally, there were different methods it might have used to dish the pain back out at the top of the hour, but apparently, it interfaced with the soul's conception of the body in order to determine what damage would have been done before directly applying it.\n\nI was envious of the armor, naturally. I had given up my sword to Bethel, and didn't have a replacement yet. The armor I traditionally wore was fine, but it was a little bit lackluster. Valencia took the Memory Blade too, though we didn't really have a good way of testing it, not given that we wanted to keep all our memories.\n\nBeyond the armor and the blades, Valencia also wore the crown, which was made of thorns in what was painfully obvious as a reference to Jesus. Given the thorns, I was thinking it would be some sort of damage reflection, but no, it soaked up poisons and toxins (from a preset list without need for bodily reference) and transformed them into mental afflictions.\n\n\"I'll get some guns for you too,\" said Amaryllis. \"There's absolutely no reason that we should waste your perfect aim by handing you a sword. We're at least six months out from our machine shops being up and running, let alone able to produce the knock-off P90s I want, but I have a shipment of pistols and rifles coming in.\"\n\n\"You do?\" I asked.\n\n\"We're the military of this country right now,\" said Amaryllis. \"Against a single fireteam, I tend to like our odds, depending on their composition, especially if they attack us in this house, in which case they have virtually no chance. That said, it would be idiotic if we died because I wasn't willing to spend a few thousand obols on firearms. And if someone comes for us, then after what happened with Larkspur, I doubt that they'll err on the side of underestimating us.\"\n\nI considered that a chilling reminder of the kind of situation we were in -- but a more chilling reminder was yet to come.\n\nName of the Beast\n\n\"Jorge and I are going on a date,\" said Valencia as she came into the common room and flopped down in a chair."}, {"speaker": "Amaryllis", "text": "Thrones?"}, {"speaker": "NARRATOR", "text": "igno, it was a biological urge, one that they couldn't satisfy themselves any more than they could tickle themselves. The need would get worse and worse, becoming a distraction and eventually a compulsion, until something had to be done about it. For dwarves, it was somewhat the opposite; a dwarf was never overcome with need, or even really experienced more than a shade of it, not unless there was some physical stimulus. Instead, sex tended to be something that dwarves engaged in only for the purposes of procreation, though as a parthenogenetic species, they didn't even need that. Dwarves found the actual physical process highly enjoyable, but there was never much element of compulsion to it, and they would rarely seek it out.\n\nDing shifted his position on the couch, and joked that maybe the next time he was having trouble with his studies because he needed relief, he would ask Grak for some help. It wasn't really a joke though ... and Grak wasn't at all averse.\n\nGrak spent a long time explaining this to me, all in Groglir, while I strained to keep up and interjected occasionally in order to get clarifications on sentence construction and vocabulary.\n\n\"I had not known what would await me in the world outside of Darili Irid, only that I wanted it,\" said Grak. \"I had always found the dwarfhold too small, too ordered, too limited, even though I loved and honored Darili Irid. My position as most-pure put burdens on me. There were many duties to attend to. Learning the way of wards at Barriers was another one of those duties, one I had sought out because it was as much freedom as I had thought I would ever get in life. I wanted to try new things, do you understand? I had no itch for coitus, but Ding was a friend, and if I could help him to scratch that itch, I was eager to assist him.\" (He was much more fluent in Groglir.)\n\nSo they had their 'experimental coitus', which was largely led by Ding, and which Grak found quite pleasurable, even if he'd had no particular craving for it when they started.\n\nOnce they were done, the fallout began, and never really stopped.\n\n\"It was a mix of cultural baggage, misunderstandings, and differences of our species,\" said Grak. \"I felt a deep kinship with Ding. To me, he was krin, or at least krinrael.\"\n\n(I don't think I can do those words justice with a translation. 'Krin' was someone you were physically intimate with, often to the level of sharing a bed naked with them, and 'krinrael' was that, but much more temporary, not an ongoing arrangement. It didn't imply that you were dating, or that you even talked all that much, but it often was a stepping stone to more intimate or contractual arrangements, like the dwarven version of marriage and/or pair-breeding. You could have more than one krin, but it wasn't particularly common. There was some element of (or at least some suggestion toward) sex, but dwarves didn't place all that much emphasis on sex, and it wasn't what a dwarf would think of when they thought of krin.)\n\n\"You were not that to him?\" I asked.\n\nGrak shook his head. \"When the act was done he had no interest,\" said Grak. \"A switch had been flipped. He did not avoid me, but to him it was as he said, a need to be fulfilled with assistance and nothing more. He did not care about the intimacy.\" Grak frowned. \"I cared. Nadi did too.\"\n\nAs it turned out, Nadi had her own designs on Ding. Her people were originally tunnel-dwellers, in the closest thing that Aerb had to an Underdark, but their aversion to open spaces was a weakness they recognized as a society, so many of their stories were about explorers and adventurers, heroes who bravely walked wide-open plains with nothing but the sky above them. From a certain point of view, Ding fit in with the heroic archetypes common among kle'tan. He wasn't an explorer or adventurer, but he bravely sought out new and exciting things for them to try as a group, and he was cosmopolitan in a way that all the best kle'tan heroes were. Naturally, she had a crush on him.\n\nI kind of liked hearing Grak relive all of this ancient drama. He was still talking at a fast clip, leaving me in a frantic rush to comprehend and extrapolate things that I had missed, but he didn't really express himself much, especially not on interpersonal issues. The recounting he was giving me was tinged with emotion, which I didn't get from him very often either; he was slow to laugh, and easy to get in a sullen mood, which was, to be honest, part of why I didn't talk to him all that much.\n\n\"She was upset when she found out,\" said Grak. \"She felt like she had been betrayed. Ding explained it as a moment of craving, nothing important or meaningful to him. I felt hurt by that. He was my first krin, or so I had thought. We all wanted different things from each other. Nadi wanted a pair-bonding, I wanted continued intimacy, and Ding only wanted to not have his mind clouded by thoughts of fornication. I understood none of that at the time. To me it was as if he had declared us krin, then rescinded that the next day. My feelings toward Nadi were more complicated, especially after they had sex together.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I said. \"They had a relationship?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Grak. \"Ding felt his mind clouded by need again, which filled him with desire for outlet. Nadi ... she had positioned herself to be alone with him. She offered herself to him, but I do not know what she was thinking.\"\n\nI thought back on Grak giving me the abbreviated version of this, months ago, not long after we'd first met. I didn't think that the situation between Amaryllis, Fenn, and myself was all that similar, especially since cultural (mis)understandings weren't really a huge issue ... but especially when he was speaking his native language, and opening up more about the specifics of what happened, I could see where he was coming from. And really ... things had gotten messy and complicated, and had only been mostly resolved because Amaryllis was willing to alter her own soul in order to get it done. If not for that, we would still be in an unstable equilibrium.\n\n\"How did it end?\" I asked, after Grak had stayed silent for a time.\n\n\"If Nadi had hoped he would feel some affection toward her, she was let down,\" said Grak. \"She felt used, after, which was an accurate understanding of the situation. We all felt betrayed by each other, for different reasons. It was the end of our friendship.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said. I paused, licking my lips and trying to think of the right words. \"They were your best friends. It can be hard to have things fall apart. What did you do after?\"\n\n\"There were many dwarves at Barriers,\" said Grak. \"I spent a year cloistering myself with them. We ate dwarven food, sang dwarven music, and pretended that we were in a dwarfhold. I had a proper krin.\" He shrugged. \"I had liked that feeling of need from Ding. It was not something that a dwarf could provide. Not a traditional one.\"\n\n\"On the train,\" I said. \"Magor. He seemed aggressive.\"\n\n\"He was not traditional,\" answered Grak. He stared down at the flashlight. \"We had a good time together. I have thought about inviting him to the Isle of Poran.\"\n\n\"That serious?\" I asked.\n\nGrak shook his head. \"No. He was barely krinrael.\" He looked up at me. \"I am lonesome.\"\n\n\"You have us,\" I said. \"I know that it does not feel like it --\"\n\n\"It does,\" said Grak. He heaved a sigh.\n\n\"Then I do not ...\" I stopped, trying to think about it. \"I was going to say that we are not dwarves. You do not think that important though? You said a year cloistered with other dwarves. After that?\"\n\n\"It was too much like home,\" said Grak. \"I loved it, but it grated. I abandoned the false dwarfhold and made new friends of all species, most of them other students at Barriers. I had a few krin. One of them lasted three years, though there was no question of anything more.\"\n\n\"But you weren't lonesome then?\" I asked.\n\n\"No,\" said Grak. He paused. \"I had a different idea of what it meant to be Grakhuil Leadbraids, back then.\"\n\n\"You said --\" I tried to think about what I knew, and how to connect the dots. \"Your biography, given to me by the game, said that you returned to Darili Irid and were entered into an arranged marriage.\" I wasn't sure of the exact construction there, since I was just taking the idiom of 'arranged marriage' and translating it literally, 'ari mamin'.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Grak. \"I had built a life at Barriers. It was stripped away when I made the long journey home. I was most-pure, and clan warder on top of that. It was a return to obligations. My father had decided upon a mate for me, not mere krin but a father to my children. Gone so long, with letters home that became fewer as the years passed, they thought I needed something to tie me more tightly to the clan. At the prospect of being tied, I realized that it was not the life I wanted, in spite of my affection for the place.\"\n\nI frowned, trying to think about that. \"But now you want back,\" I said.\n\nGrak stayed silent.\n\n\"Or ... not,\" I said.\n\nGrak continued his silence.\n\n\"You keep using the word penance,\" I said. \"A self-punishment?\" The game had told me as much, in the text of his companion quest.\n\nGrak wasn't looking at anything in particular. I greatly preferred conversational tooth-pulling with Fenn, where getting her to speak meant wading through jokes and diversions rather than silence.\n\n\"Something happened to Darili Irid,\" I said. I paused, watching him. \"You came back. They tried to force a life on you. You left. And then -- I don't want to guess at what tragedy happened because they didn't have a warder. I will guess, if you don't tell me.\"\n\n\"It is time for us to go back,\" he said, finally switching to Anglish.\n\n\"Something horrible,\" I said, staying in Groglir. \"An invasion? A theft?\" I wasn't that eloquent to him, I'm sure, since the ideas I was trying to express had to be cobbled together from words that I already knew. \"Assassination?\"\n\n\"Accident,\" said Grak. I saw his jaw move slightly as he clenched his teeth. \"A ward failed. They had hired a warder, cheap, part-time, to replace the old dwarf I was meant to take over from. He had little training. Little knowledge. Three years, provisionally licensed, but,\" Grak rubbed at his nose with the back of his hand. \"Darili Irid was deep beneath the surface. There were complex wards to shape the flow of air, to keep it clean. We used processes that were dangerous. When the ward failed, the air fouled, quickly.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I said. \"Your father ... ?\"\n\n\"Everyone,\" said Grak.\n\n\"Oh,\" I said again. \"Shit. That's,\" I folded my hands in my lap instead of saying more. It was horrifying, for a start. I had questions about how such a thing could even happen, what safety checks had failed, what alarms had been silent or just not installed, but before I could put my foot in my mouth, I realized those were the questions that Grak would have asked himself in the days and weeks after he'd learned it had happened. He wasn't telling me so I could diagnose the problem, or propose a solution. \"Can I -- how many?\"\n\n\"Two thousand, three hundred, forty-six,\" said Grak. \"Everyone.\"\n\nI tried to grapple with that number. It seemed too big. It seemed like the kind of thing that would have made national headlines, something that couldn't possibly have escaped my notice ... but I hadn't been searching for answers, and Darili Irid was, by Grak's account, a small hole in the ground whose primary interaction with imperial affairs was paying a pittance in taxes. Put in that context ... there had been an explosion in China, some kind of factory, killing thousands, and all I could vaguely recall was watching a video on Youtube that had synced the views from different cameras. And there had been a stampede in Mecca, hadn't there? Thousands of people crushed to death, and I probably only remembered it happening because I loved the worldbuilding aspects of giant pilgrimage sites. That helped me to put it into context, a bit. I wondered how many disasters and accidents I had seen on television and then completely forgotten about a few minutes later.\n\nTwo thousand dead, and it probably hadn't been enough to register more than a single column several pages into the international papers.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" I said.\n\nTo my shock, Grak was crying.\n\n\"It wasn't your fault,\" I said. I wanted to switch from Groglir back to Anglish, where the words would flow more easily and I could phrase things more politely, but I had already cottoned on to the fact that it was easier for Grak to hide himself when he spoke a foreign tongue. \"Whatever mistake happened, you do not owe them your life.\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Grak. He was crying more now, sobbing, overwhelmed. I shifted in my seat on the floor for just a bit, then moved over and put my arm around him, patting him gently on the back. He leaned into me, and rested his head on my shoulder as he cried. It was a bit awkward, but I'd never had someone cry on me and not had it feel like that.\n\nSo many things about Grak were coming into focus for me, different things that he'd said or done. His focus on the penance was on paying down some karmic debt, and it wasn't actually about the gold, it was about ensuring that he was staying on that path. Fenn had called us all suicidal on more than one occasion, but along with what Amaryllis had said to him at the hospital, I got the impression that was literally true. He blamed himself for what had happened, and there was no way to ever make it right, but he was devoting himself to the pursuit of restoring that karmic debt, throwing himself into situations where death was a possibility.\n\nI'd seen Grak injured a few times, some of them pretty serious. I'd always thought his flat reaction was just dwarven stubbornness in the face of injury, a gruff, manly response to getting hurt. That was sort of how I had seen him in general, a man unaffected by the world, stoic in the face of adversity. It hadn't really occurred to me that he was depressed and waiting to die.\n\nWe held our hug for a long time.\n\nI wanted to tell him that I understood. In the depths of my depression, every scrap of happiness I'd somehow managed to secure felt like it was a betrayal of Arthur's memory, a dagger planted in his back. I'd driven people away because I didn't think that I deserved them. I had so much anger and sadness, feeding into each other, that the world seemed like it had nothing to offer me. I hadn't cared whether I'd lived or died, and then when I hit bottom, as low as I could go ...\n\nI tried to kill myself.\n\nI didn't say this to Grak. It wasn't something that I had said out loud yet. I was worried that he would think I was making things up about myself, or that he was only looking for comfort, not for us to relate to one another, or that I had misread what he was doing with the penance.\n\nThe more I thought about it though, the more I thought that was just me making up excuses to cover the real reason. I didn't want to say it because it was painful to say, and I thought that he would think less of me for it, or at least think differently about me. It wasn't something that I had told Fenn or Amaryllis. I didn't want to expose the weakness of trying to take the easy way out, nor the weakness of not being able to follow through on it. I'd been pretty successful in not so much as thinking about it.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Grak.\n\n\"We are here for you,\" I said. He pulled back slightly, and I released him from the hug. \"I know you know that. I know that ... that it probably feels like forging a new life for yourself is --\"\n\n\"Not possible,\" said Grak.\n\nQuest Updated: All That Glitters - Go with Grakhuil Leadbraids to the mausoleum of Darili Irid when he's amassed one thousand pounds of gold. You are the only one who can help him make peace. (517/1000) (Companion Quest)\n\nI stayed quiet. I wasn't actually sure that the quest was accurate, since they'd been inaccurate before. I had a hard time believing that I was the only one that could do it, given that social stuff was definitely not my forte, and I wasn't much of a real friend to Grak. He'd only confided in me because ... well, that was a question mark, and I didn't know him well enough to say. I was under the impression that Amaryllis got on his nerves a little bit, though I couldn't really have said why, except that maybe it was for the same reasons she got on my nerves.\n\n\"Okay,\" I said. I'd finally given up and made the switch back to Anglish. \"I'm not going to force the issue. We'll help you get your gold, ideally before the two years are up, and then I'll come with you to Darili Irid.\" I'd been trying to think of the lines that I might use to convince him to stay with us, but nothing I thought of sounded convincing, and I was pretty sure that in his position, I wouldn't have listened.\n\nLoyalty Increased: Grak lvl 13!\n\nI didn't feel good about that. Grak was his own person, he wanted to be his own person, finding us and becoming a part of the Council of Arches, heart and soul, was, in his eyes, sort of a betrayal of the person he thought of himself as being. All I was really doing was increasing that tension, without actually helping to ease or resolve it. I didn't know whether loyalty actually did anything, aside from the bonuses it granted, but I hadn't seen it go down yet, and if it was magically modifying their minds instead of just acting as a gauge of what they thought about me ... well, that wouldn't feel good either.\n\nFenn looked out over the haul from the cavern, which we'd dumped out of the glove. Grak had gone to be on his own, which I could understand. That left me, Fenn, Bethel, Amaryllis, and, of course, Valencia.\n\n\"I don't understand why someone would use some of this stuff,\" said Fenn.\n\n\"Mortals are attracted to power,\" said Bethel. \"The ones who tried to raid me were more attracted than most. Some of them were desperate, and many of these tools are the tools of desperation.\"\n\nMy eyes landed on the Memory Blade, which I thought was a good contender for Valencia's primary weapon. It became sharper the more memories it ate, and according to Bethel, at its height it was capable of cutting through stone like it was soft butter. It fed from both the person who wielded it and whoever it hit, heedless of the damage it was causing. Valencia didn't have memories, or at least, not memories stored in her soul, which meant that in theory, she could use the blade with only the upside. It was dull now, since it had been a century since it was used, but it could build up again with time.\n\n\"Armor is going to be a problem,\" said Amaryllis. \"Most of it will change shape to fit whoever wears it, at least to some extent, but I'm not sure that will work for Valencia.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't be too hard to get a body double, right?\" I asked.\n\n\"We're talking about cursed armor here,\" said Fenn. \"Maybe let's not put random strangers into it?\"\n\nValencia was staring at a suit of red armor covered with tiny, curved thorns. Bethel had termed it the Red Armor of Arramor, which was one I'd come up with for our Long Stairs campaign. If you were wearing it, you wouldn't take any damage until the top of the hour, at which point that damage would be dealt to both the wearer and whoever had done the damage. There were a bunch of ways to bypass it, but it was total protection against a whole lot of damage. In our games, the biggest catch to it had been that healing didn't actually work until after you'd taken the damage ... which came all at once, triggering massive damage rules and/or pushing people below the maximum amount of negative damage. You also couldn't take it off if you had damage pending, which Reimer learned to his intense displeasure; he wasn't terribly good at roleplaying a guy who knew he only had fifteen minutes to live.\n\n\"We'll need to test some of this stuff,\" I said. \"Test whether the armor will conform to Valencia, test which parts of which abilities work, et cetera. Shouldn't take us more than a day, I don't think.\"\n\n\"Was any of this meant for me?\" asked Valencia. She was staring at the armor as she spoke it.\n\n\"Meant for you?\" asked Bethel.\n\n\"The Dungeon Master nudges things sometimes,\" I said. \"He, uh, sets things up. Let's say there are a billion entads, most of them not great, right? Well, we've come across what, maybe two dozen so far? Much more, if you include all the ones that nominally belong to Amaryllis, or the ones that I've heard about in passing, and definitely if you include Uther's stuff. But of the ones that we actually have, or have interacted with, a hugely disproportionate number have been ones that I personally created, or which were used in the games that I played. It's proof of the Dungeon Master's thumb on the scale somewhere in the process.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Bethel. She frowned at all the entads she'd chosen not to take in. \"So the thought is that this powerful entity sent people to their deaths inside of me because he foresaw that I would elect not to take them, that you would come to me, that I would choose not to kill you, and that Valencia would both be present in this party and live through her altercation at Headwater.\"\n\n\"Valencia is invincible,\" said Fenn.\n\n\"Am not,\" said Valencia.\n\n\"Are too,\" said Fenn. She had some experience; they'd been training together in the gym, and despite Fenn's avowed laziness, she had been spending a fair amount of time there. \"I've never seen you take a hit. 'If you prick her, does she not bleed?' Well, no, because you're not going to be able to prick her, she'll dodge out of the way of the needle and then break your arm in two places.\"\n\n\"I said I was sorry,\" said Valencia.\n\n\"Never said I was upset,\" said Fenn.\n\n\"You swore a lot,\" said Amaryllis. \"And then said that you were going to break her arm in her sleep.\"\n\n\"I say a lot of things,\" said Fenn.\n\n\"Back to the matter at hand,\" I said. \"Yes, it's very possible that the Dungeon Master either foresaw everything and nudged it into the right configuration, or foresaw bits and pieces of things and set up a bunch of possibilities. Maybe ... I mean, it's possible that each of these was intended for a different possible future, and the ones that seem obviously meant for Valencia are just because that's the timeline we ended up in, right?\"\n\n\"I'm kind of over the existential stuff,\" said Fenn. \"Bible study helped a lot with that.\"\n\n\"It's also possible that the Dungeon Master cheats more than he lets on,\" said Amaryllis. \"He simply placed that armor there for Valencia a few days ago and retroactively altered all memories and evidence to fit a world where it had always been there.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said. \"If we're talking about random bullshit powers, yes, that's entirely possible.\"\n\n\"But it's to our benefit,\" said Bethel.\n\n\"I'm going to try the armor on,\" said Valencia.\n\n\"Sure,\" I said. \"We'll test it in the least harmful way possible.\"\n\n\"It's to our benefit now,\" said Amaryllis. \"In the future? Maybe not so much. Also in the past, though it's hard to say.\"\n\n\"She's still salty about the password-protected tattoo variant,\" said Fenn with a laugh.\n\n\"Because it was bullshit,\" said Amaryllis. \"The whole fucking thing, and yes, I'm still quote salty unquote about it. We were specifically fucked by a black swan.\"\n\n\"Like Leda,\" said Fenn.\n\n\"Sometimes there are black swans,\" I said, ignoring whatever nonsense Fenn was talking about. \"I mean, you don't include them in narratives without some foreshadowing or multiple viewpoints, which basically means that you don't do them in tabletop games, but ... I thought maybe that was the point?\"\n\n\"The fuck kind of point is that?\" asked Fenn.\n\n\"I'm inclined to agree with the spirit of that question,\" said Bethel.\n\n\"No, I understand it,\" said Amaryllis. \"Fenn, did you ever get around to reading A Game of Thrones ?\""}, {"speaker": "Fenn", "text": "Nope,"}, {"speaker": "NARRATOR", "text": "said Fenn."}, {"speaker": "Fenn", "text": "If you wanted me to read books, you shouldn't have invented television."}, {"speaker": "Amaryllis", "text": "It's fine,"}, {"speaker": "NARRATOR", "text": "said Amaryllis."}, {"speaker": "Amaryllis", "text": "It was just a good example.

My attempts at putting some distance between Valencia and myself seemed to be working, at least as far as her attachment to me went. I knew that her sight into the hells was a bit limited, not enough for surveillance, though we had infernoscopes for that if we really needed, and if we didn't want to look at anything too far down. I also knew that the tendrils couldn't be used on people in hell, which had been one of my first questions; that, at least, would have been a no-brainer, whatever you thought about the wisdom of antagonizing the infernals.\n\nWe moved on to other topics, and went through a few cycles of testing weapons and armor for Valencia. The game had termed her Valencia the Red, and as it turned out, the Red Armor of Arramor worked perfectly on her, which was a little bit on the nose. There were different methods that armor used to shape itself to a person, and the Red Armor of Arramor used the method that would have worked on a sack of potatoes; conforming to whatever was placed inside it and hoping that the joints would work out on their own. There were different methods of reducing damage, or even knowing what damage was, and the Red Armor of Arramor used the method that would have worked on a sack of potatoes, stopping 'incoming' kinetic energy with respect to itself if preset thresholds were exceeded. And finally, there were different methods it might have used to dish the pain back out at the top of the hour, but apparently, it interfaced with the soul's conception of the body in order to determine what damage would have been done before directly applying it.\n\nI was envious of the armor, naturally. I had given up my sword to Bethel, and didn't have a replacement yet. The armor I traditionally wore was fine, but it was a little bit lackluster. Valencia took the Memory Blade too, though we didn't really have a good way of testing it, not given that we wanted to keep all our memories.\n\nBeyond the armor and the blades, Valencia also wore the crown, which was made of thorns in what was painfully obvious as a reference to Jesus. Given the thorns, I was thinking it would be some sort of damage reflection, but no, it soaked up poisons and toxins (from a preset list without need for bodily reference) and transformed them into mental afflictions.\n\n\"I'll get some guns for you too,\" said Amaryllis. \"There's absolutely no reason that we should waste your perfect aim by handing you a sword. We're at least six months out from our machine shops being up and running, let alone able to produce the knock-off P90s I want, but I have a shipment of pistols and rifles coming in.\"\n\n\"You do?\" I asked."}, {"speaker": "Amaryllis", "text": "We're the military of this country right now,"}, {"speaker": "NARRATOR", "text": "said Amaryllis."}, {"speaker": "Amaryllis", "text": "Against a single fireteam, I tend to like our odds, depending on their composition, especially if they attack us in this house, in which case they have virtually no chance.
