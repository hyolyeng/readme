<Juniper>"In monomythic terms?"</Juniper> I asked. <Juniper>"No. It's more … the later parts of the hero's journey, the death and rebirth. That's what worries me, being forged into something new, and maybe something unpleasant."</Juniper> I paused. <Juniper>"Shit. We missed something."</Juniper>

<Amaryllis>"We did?"</Amaryllis> asked Amaryllis.

<Juniper>"The name,"</Juniper> I said. I saw her stiffen slightly. <Juniper>"It's the name of a famous actor on Earth. We need to get to Speculation and Scrutiny and warn them, because that's a disaster waiting to happen. You've said before that the nation's pursuit is going to be the spread of technological development for personal gain, and I've said that the group's pursuit should be doing things that only we can do. I'm pretty sure that this is one of those things. There are a bunch of people from Earth there, and the moment one of them says the name of a well-known actor, it's going to be a disaster."</Juniper>

<Amaryllis>"Fuck,"</Amaryllis> said Amaryllis.

<Fenn>"So, he's an actor?"</Fenn> asked Fenn.

<Amaryllis>"Fenn,"</Amaryllis> said Amaryllis. <Amaryllis>"Don't ask about him."</Amaryllis>

<Fenn>"I just want to know whether I've seen anything he's been in,"</Fenn> said Fenn. <Fenn>"Is that so much to ask?"</Fenn>

<Juniper>"Odds are you haven't,"</Juniper> I replied. <Juniper>"I know that media gets a bit spotty as you go further forward in time, since there's stuff that never went to VHS. DVD came out in, uh ..."</Juniper>

<Amaryllis>"1995,"</Amaryllis> said Amaryllis. <Amaryllis>"But they still made movies on VHS as late as 2006."</Amaryllis>

<Juniper>"Huh,"</Juniper> I said. <Juniper>"Yeah, that sounds right."</Juniper>

<Amaryllis>"It is,"</Amaryllis> replied Amaryllis.

<Fenn>"But it would be useful to know if I had seen him somewhere, right?"</Fenn> asked Fenn. <Fenn>"Like, as an instrumental?"</Fenn>

<Amaryllis>"Instrumental what?"</Amaryllis> asked Amaryllis.

<Fenn>"... utility?"</Fenn> asked Fenn.

<Grak>"I would prefer not to tempt fate,"</Grak> said Grak.

<Fenn>"It's not tempting fate, it's learning,"</Fenn> said Fenn. <Fenn>"It can't possibly hurt anything to know what the Cannibal was in,"</Fenn> she pointed to me. <Fenn>"Joon?"</Fenn>

<Juniper>"Uh, Transformers,"</Juniper> I said.

Fenn froze. <Fenn>"Wait, really? Transformers, robots in disguise, more than meets the eye, those Transformers? Because we totally saw that one. It's got Citizen Kane, right?"</Fenn>

<Juniper>"What?"</Juniper> I asked. I tried to see some way that she could have misunderstood something, but was coming up blank.

<Amaryllis>"We need to shut this line of conversation down,"</Amaryllis> said Amaryllis. <Amaryllis>"Too much risk."</Amaryllis>

<Juniper>"Wait, I want to understand what Fenn is talking about,"</Juniper> I said. <Juniper>"I really thought that getting you all exposure to Earth stuff would help, but it's not really been the case. Half of the references are just gibberish to me."</Juniper>

<Fenn>"Because you're uncultured,"</Fenn> said Fenn with a huff. <Fenn>"Kane, from Citizen Kane, he was a Transformer, and apparently the world-eating cannibal was in it too."</Fenn>

Solace leaned over to Valencia. <Solace>"Should I be following any of this? What's a robot?"</Solace>

Valencia shrugged. <Valencia>"Sometimes I think they all went mad down in the time chamber."</Valencia>

<Amaryllis>"To clarify, he won't eat the world,"</Amaryllis> said Amaryllis. <Amaryllis>"I think it's very important to not overstate threats. At best, the cannibal will kill a fairly large number of innocent people, especially if his name is said in a place with as dense a population as one of the athenaeums."</Amaryllis>

<Grak>"What is our plan?"</Grak> asked Grak.

<Amaryllis>"We gather information first,"</Amaryllis> said Amaryllis. <Amaryllis>"There's a lot that we don't know about the dream-skewered. They're a very, very niche curiosity."</Amaryllis>

<Fenn>"Who you know about, in depth,"</Fenn> said Fenn. She rolled her eyes. <Fenn>"Naturally."</Fenn>

<Amaryllis>"I really don't,"</Amaryllis> said Amaryllis. <Amaryllis>"It's included, briefly, in most reckonings of the greater cosmology, usually nestled somewhere between a paragraph on the excluded mirror dimension and a summary of the more hypothetical elemental planes. Before I met Joon, everything that I knew about Earth could have fit in a few pages, if that. I read The Dream that Skewers, which is authoritative, while I was in the chamber, but it's a very thin book, and most of it is filled with musings rather than hard data. You'd think that if you were going to write a whole book about a group of people that claim to come from a shared alternate reality, you would include very important things like, I don't know, the year that they think it is, or the names of the major governments."</Amaryllis>

<Juniper>"You never asked me,"</Juniper> I said.

<Amaryllis>"Well,"</Amaryllis> said Amaryllis. She shifted slightly. <Amaryllis>"I did eventually. It didn't seem important until much later."</Amaryllis>

<Juniper>"It's kind of not,"</Juniper> I replied with a shrug. <Juniper>"I read the book too."</Juniper> I looked to the others. <Juniper>"It was more about Earth as a concept, the affliction, a few case studies, the facilities at Speculation and Scrutiny, the care provided there … it really went in the direction of The Care and Feeding of Dream-Skewered. There's not a bunch about Earth. If you don't actually care about Earth, which might as well not exist except so far as the deluded dream-skewered people think it does, then you don't care so much about timelines."</Juniper>

<Valencia>"What year is it on Earth?"</Valencia> asked Valencia.

<Juniper>"2017,"</Juniper> I said.

Valencia nodded. <Valencia>"I don't know what that means. Fifteen hundred years in the future?"</Valencia>

<Amaryllis>"They use a different calendar,"</Amaryllis> said Amaryllis.

<Juniper>"I guess when I think about it, it took me quite a while to ask what year it was,"</Juniper> I said. <Juniper>"Unless you're time traveling or studying history, it's not really important."</Juniper>

<Amaryllis>"You said that 1990 was the cut-off for our problem?"</Amaryllis> asked Amaryllis. <Amaryllis>"Anything before that, we don't care about?"</Amaryllis>

<Juniper>"I … think so?"</Juniper> I asked. <Juniper>"He was a child actor, but … I don't know when he really rose to fame. It was Even Stevens, I think? But that was before my time. I also don't know how old he is. Twenties or thirties, I guess, so let's say … he was probably born between 1977 and 1997."</Juniper>

<Fenn>"Wait,"</Fenn> said Fenn. <Fenn>"When did Transformers come out?"</Fenn>

<Juniper>"Uh,"</Juniper> I said. <Juniper>"No clue, but I would say after 2000 before 2010?"</Juniper>

<Fenn>"And I suppose we can't use IMDB?"</Fenn> asked Fenn, aiming that question at Amaryllis.

<Amaryllis>"Absolutely not,"</Amaryllis> said Amaryllis. <Amaryllis>"No web pages, period. I'm not just worried about the cannibal, I'm worried about other, hidden infohazards. Things that Joon didn't think would make the leap, or which were intended as jokes."</Amaryllis>

<Juniper>"I'm sorry,"</Juniper> I said. <Juniper>"But I really don't think this one is on me. I mean, it's a lot more not on me than all the other stuff, which is also not my fault or responsibility. The purpose wasn't to torture game characters … or, I guess it was to torture them as a joke, which is totally different."</Juniper>

<Grak>"Will it be funny if the cannibal kills us?"</Grak> asked Grak.

<Juniper>"Uh,"</Juniper> I said. <Juniper>"Not to me, but from a certain point of view … yeah."</Juniper>

<Fenn>"Well that's fucking great,"</Fenn> said Fenn. She paused for a moment. <Fenn>"Wait! You have that virtue!"</Fenn>

<Juniper>"I do?"</Juniper> I asked.

<Fenn>"You take half as much damage from physical comedy, so long as it's funny, right?"</Fenn> asked Fenn.

<Amaryllis>"You … may actually have a point,"</Amaryllis> said Amaryllis.

<Juniper>"Regardless,"</Juniper> I replied. <Juniper>"It's not going to be a problem, because no one is going to say it. We don't even have Bethel with us, which means that there's no possibility that someone will try to pull something innocuous from Earth and trip the trigger by accident. Which we're not actually sure is a possibility in the first place."</Juniper>

<Fenn>"I'm pretty sure that Transformers didn't come out when you think it did,"</Fenn> said Fenn with a frown. <Fenn>"And I really want to keep using the backpack, because guess what, there's no one on Aerb that knows how to make sushi. Plus Earth bras are great."</Fenn>

<Amaryllis>"I don't think there's an infohazard risk for clothing,"</Amaryllis> said Amaryllis. <Amaryllis>"But we need to have a serious discussion on opsec with regards to that particular ability, because there are going to be people gunning for us, and it's better that no one makes the connection until after we've already established ourselves enough that they can't knock our feet from under us."</Amaryllis>

<Valencia>"I'm sorry that Uniquities found out,"</Valencia> said Valencia.

<Amaryllis>"They don't know the full truth,"</Amaryllis> said Amaryllis. <Amaryllis>"All they have are some books."</Amaryllis>

<Valencia>"Well, I'm still sorry,"</Valencia> said Valencia.

<Fenn>"Can we talk about the Citizen Kane thing?"</Fenn> asked Fenn. <Fenn>"This is bugging me."</Fenn>

I looked up the slope. <Juniper>"We've got a few minutes,"</Juniper> I said. <Juniper>"But I'm pretty sure you're wrong, and we don't have anything to reference in order to settle it. Transformers is, uh, not what I would consider a cultural touchstone, not in the same way that Star Wars or -- oh, shit, don't watch the fourth Indiana Jones movie."</Juniper>

<Fenn>"I didn't even know there was a fourth,"</Fenn> said Fenn. <Fenn>"Wasn't on your list."</Fenn>

<Valencia>"I don't even know what Indiana Jones is,"</Valencia> said Valencia with a frown.

<Fenn>"Well, movie night is going to be on hold, apparently,"</Fenn> said Fenn. <Fenn>"I should still be able to watch anime though, right?"</Fenn>

<Juniper>"Subs or dubs?"</Juniper> I asked.

Fenn frowned at me. <Fenn>"Mary doesn't have subtitles working."</Fenn>

<Amaryllis>"Do you have any idea -- no, I know that you don't,"</Amaryllis> said Amaryllis. <Amaryllis>"But if we're talking about EIA-608 encoding, which is the simplest form of closed captioning I could probably do, it's not something that I'm ever going to have the time or manpower to work on, especially since I'm going to gather a standards council together in order to make our own, Aerb-specific standards."</Amaryllis>

<Valencia>"You're so great,"</Valencia> said Valencia.

<Juniper>"I was only asking because if it's dubs, then you'd have to be careful,"</Juniper> I said. <Juniper>"He might have done voice work."</Juniper>

<Fenn>"This is bullshit,"</Fenn> said Fenn. <Fenn>"And yes, obviously he's done voice work, but American voice work, right? Blugh, I hate this."</Fenn>

<Solace>"I somewhat enjoy it,"</Solace> said Solace.

<Amaryllis>"Um,"</Amaryllis> said Amaryllis. <Amaryllis>"What?"</Amaryllis>

The trolley car crested up to flat ground then came to a stop, in a long line with the others. Trolleys left every few minutes, in a continuous circuit.

<Amaryllis>"Sorry, hold that thought,"</Amaryllis> said Amaryllis. <Amaryllis>"We're going full opsec, no breaches of the fourteen points of contention."</Amaryllis>

<Fenn>"What's opsec?"</Fenn> asked Fenn.

Amaryllis glared at her, then slid her helmet on as the doors opened.

<Valencia>"Well, I thought it was funny,"</Valencia> said Valencia.

<Grak>"A bit,"</Grak> said Grak.

<Young_man>"Yes?"</Young_man> it asked.

<Valencia>"Male, human, bored, wary,"</Valencia> said Valencia. She was speaking at a bare whisper, just behind my shoulder. If this was a trap, I had the feeling the jig would be up for them in short order.

<Juniper>"I was hoping to speak to Speculator Masters,"</Juniper> I said. <Juniper>"I had a few questions."</Juniper> The name was one we'd picked up while we were in Boastre Vino, no thanks to me. <Juniper>"This is the place the dream-skewered are housed, isn't it?"</Juniper>

The speaker was silent for a moment, then the gates began to creak open. <Young_man>"Someone will meet you in the lobby."</Young_man>

<Valencia>"I can't tell what the change in demeanor was,"</Valencia> said Valencia, still pitching her voice so that I could only just hear it. <Valencia>"It was either the name of Masters being mentioned, or something else."</Valencia>

<Amaryllis>"You have speculations?"</Amaryllis> asked Amaryllis, who was standing close by.

<Valencia>"They have protocols and we just tripped one,"</Valencia> said Valencia. <Valencia>"I don't have any insight beyond that. It might be paranoia. There are innocuous solutions to the question."</Valencia>

<Juniper>"It wouldn't be absurd for them to have a protocol for visitors,"</Juniper> I said.

<Valencia>"Not that kind of protocol,"</Valencia> said Valencia. <Valencia>"Something serious."</Valencia>

<Young_man>"Ah,"</Young_man> he said, taking us in. His eyes lingered on Grak's wooden hand. <Young_man>"Spec Masters will be down in a moment. Can I ask what this is regarding?"</Young_man>

<Juniper>"It's confidential,"</Juniper> I said.

The young man nodded, then swallowed. <Young_man>"He'll be right down. If you could sign in?"</Young_man> He pushed a clipboard across his desk, and Amaryllis picked it up, filling it in with our real names, save for her own, which matched the official pseudonym she used on the Isle of Poran.

<Speculator_Masters>"Speculator Masters,"</Speculator_Masters> he said, coming forward and shaking my hand first. I briefly wondered why that was, but I wasn't too troubled by it; Amaryllis had said that she would defer to me, since I had far more knowledge about Earth and the threat surface of the infohazard.

<Juniper>"Juniper Smith,"</Juniper> I said. <Juniper>"We're the Council of Arches. There's something highly confidential that we need to discuss with you."</Juniper>

<Speculator_Masters>"All of you?"</Speculator_Masters> asked Masters with a raised eyebrow. His eyes went to Valencia's pistols and sword. <Speculator_Masters>"Am I in any danger?"</Speculator_Masters>

<Juniper>"This whole facility is,"</Juniper> I said. <Juniper>"And yes, I would prefer that we all stayed together."</Juniper>

Masters looked at the six of us. <Speculator_Masters>"May I ask whether this is in regards to the dream-skewered?"</Speculator_Masters>

<Juniper>"Yes,"</Juniper> I said. <Juniper>"I won't say more until we're in private and under a fair number of wards."</Juniper>

Masters didn't move. <Speculator_Masters>"I'm not familiar with the Council of Arches."</Speculator_Masters>

<Juniper>"We're a relatively new national agency,"</Juniper> I said. <Juniper>"We recently happened to come across some information that it's critically important for you to have."</Juniper> Not that we were going to actually tell him, but we did need to give him the bare bones and talk with him about how the dream-skewered were handled with regards to topics on Earth. It made me uneasy that they were presumably all together.

<Speculator_Masters>"Very well,"</Speculator_Masters> he finally said. <Speculator_Masters>"We do have a conference room available for consultations with the affected and their families. We can discuss it there. As for wards, may I assume you'll be supplying your own?"</Speculator_Masters>

<Juniper>"Yes,"</Juniper> I said with a nod.

<Speculator_Masters>"I'm listening,"</Speculator_Masters> said Masters, once Grak had confirmed that the room was about as secure as he could make it. He was still looking at me. I'd talked with Amaryllis about what I was going to say, but it felt nervous for me to be in the driver's seat.

<Juniper>"We need information first, in order to know how to present this,"</Juniper> I said.

<Speculator_Masters>"Information of what sort?"</Speculator_Masters> asked Masters.

<Juniper>"Information about Earth,"</Juniper> I replied. <Juniper>"We need to know some specifics about the world that the dream-skewered believe they come from."</Juniper>

Masters frowned slightly. <Speculator_Masters>"You believe that you might have found something that would negatively impact the health and safety of my patients or the staff at this facility?"</Speculator_Masters> he asked.

I nodded. <Juniper>"It's hard to know whether or not it's even wise to give you the barest description without knowing more about the dream-skewered."</Juniper>

Masters looked like he'd just eaten a lemon. <Speculator_Masters>"I'm going to need to screen you,"</Speculator_Masters> he said.

<Juniper>"Screen us?"</Juniper> I asked. I was already on guard, but that bumped me up a few levels.

<Speculator_Masters>"I need to check whether any of you are dream-skewered,"</Speculator_Masters> said Masters.
